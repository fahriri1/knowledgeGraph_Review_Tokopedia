D,"Tokopedia used to be my favorite marketplace to get my needs done, i love using it with the catchy UI, easy to search for the items and the great deals it offers.

Daniel Chandra,"They're faking the price by displaying the discounted price with a voucher upfront. This may seem accurate if you buy only one item, but if you try to buy more than one, the calculation gets messed up. The voucher only applies a fixed discount (e.g. 10k off, whether you buy 1 or 10 items), so the discount doesn‚Äôt scale properly with the quantity.",fake price display discount price voucher upfront accurate buy item try buy calculation get mess voucher apply fixed discount buy item discount scale properly quantity
Lou Park,"Horrifyingly inefficient user interface with unreliable search engine. Also good luck for users to post complain videos because the app would just randomly restart & drop all progress.

Matthew Wood,Lots of cheaters on tokopedia who label an item shipped and then tell you they don't have it or ship you the wrong item. Then you have to wait days to complain and the complaint process can take a week. The whole time your money is tied up. It's a giant scam and Tokopedia is not taking action to stop this widespread abuse. About 20% of my orders are canceled because the seller doesn't have what they list for sale. No way for non-indonesian citizens to verify age.

Andreas Febrian,"I love shopping in Tokopedia. However, some logic in the application does not make sense. I'll give you a list. -- First: Frequently, when I open the apps, the application gives a popup about an event or something. My reaction is, ""Wow! I have installed your mobile application, and you still give me a popup. I mean, it's your mobile application on my phone, being installed; what else do you want?"" It is annoying that I have to do an extra tap when using an application dedicatedly build for shopping in your store. Talk about a bad user experience. -- Second: Another annoying thing is that your application sometimes tries to ""help"" with my shopping list, such as buying a mobile data package. The thing is, I never use that suggestion. If you really want to help, then track which one of those ""forced shopping suggestions"" was actually used by the user and then adjust your application behavior based on that. This will provide a better user experience. -- Third: You always suggested not to communicate with sellers via media aside from your application. This means, chat feature becomes a necessary component in such a business model. Yet, you assumed buyers want to receive marketing information from any of the shops they browsed or peeked. I missed some messages from the sellers because of that. I think you need to make up your mind and redesign the chat logic. Suggestions: Provide an exclusive notification icon for the chat, including the unread message Instead of using chat, create a marketing feed that buyers can tap into voluntarily -- Fourth: The mobile application admin on Google Play always suggests user post their suggestion to tkp.me/supportMainapps. However, that page is to report problems regarding the apps, not to provide suggestions.",love shop tokopedia logic application sense list frequently open app application give popup event reaction wow instal mobile application popup mean mobile application phone instal want annoying extra tap application dedicatedly build shop store talk bad user experience second annoying thing application try help shopping list buy mobile datum package thing use suggestion want help track force shopping suggestion actually user adjust application behavior base provide well user experience suggest communicate seller medium aside application mean chat feature necessary component business model assume buyer want receive marketing information shop browse peek miss message seller think need mind redesign chat logic suggestion provide exclusive notification icon chat include unread message instead chat create marketing feed buyer tap voluntarily fourth mobile application admin google play suggest user post suggestion page report problem app provide suggestion
