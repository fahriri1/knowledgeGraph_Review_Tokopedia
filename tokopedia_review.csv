Yoga,"Bro, fix the chat feature in this app. Also, stop displaying ""discounted"" price by default, it's hard to compare the displayed product because by doing this you are making the price displayed changed depending on ""discount"". There are a lot of issues already stated by other users. Stop changing UI just for the sake of change. Why fix something that isn't broken?"
D,"Tokopedia used to be my favorite marketplace to get my needs done, i love using it with the catchy UI, easy to search for the items and the great deals it offers. But now it full of unreasonable regulation such as you can only bought maximum for 400pcs per item which is ridiculous. Most of the time the system is full of errors, when I'm just inputting for 200 but it counts as more than 400 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've contacted the CS and Tokopedia Care. This is your problem, shouldn't be mine."
Daniel Chandra,"They're faking the price by displaying the discounted price with a voucher upfront. This may seem accurate if you buy only one item, but if you try to buy more than one, the calculation gets messed up. The voucher only applies a fixed discount (e.g. 10k off, whether you buy 1 or 10 items), so the discount doesn‚Äôt scale properly with the quantity."
Lou Park,"Horrifyingly inefficient user interface with unreliable search engine. Also good luck for users to post complain videos because the app would just randomly restart & drop all progress. ""Kurir rekomendasi"" ensures things arrive too late or disappears with no proper issue resolution. And orders may be randomly cancelled just because I used a promotion that was explicitly offered & enabled by default. And my money was taken without immediate refunds, but at least it was returned. Bad marketplace."
dibahusna,"Everything went well when it did and went as awful as you could think when it didn't. Didn't have a call center, you have to wait until they call you, even when you are connected to the customer service they didn't help with new solutions but keep asking for the same ones. Would probably never use it again unless i have to because of the store üëé"
Fadhila,"Every purchase I made with a fairly large discount voucher was always canceled by Tokopedia's own system, citing non-compliance with the terms and conditions and allegations of transaction manipulation. However, when checking out with the usual voucher, it worked just fine. If the discounted voucher doesn't meet the terms and conditions, why was it allowed to be used in the first place? Im sorry but it looks to me like the large discount voucher are just gimmick"
Intan Sahara,"The newest version is just not user-friendly. I barely could find the bills menu and I have to search it on the search bar to find it. Trying so hard to be like the other competitor but losing its own identity: tidy and convenient. Please give back all the features on display, i don't want all those product suggestions in all pages."
ferdian,"The new UI is really bad, I can't find the message which previously located on the top right corner. It seems that UI/UX and product teams doens't do their job properly. Instead of adding any useful features, the teams decided to change the previously user-friendly UI, this happened quite frequently. Changing UI instead of improving their applications. As a tokopedia's old customer, I am not happy with this change and quite dissatisfied with tokopedia."
Iffat Nourandaa (Rian),"I've been using Tokopedia for years, since it is the most secure and reliable online shopping to go to. The problems are with the new policy that increasing service fees to the seller, and it definitely has some effect, that is increased products price. And the UI is a LOT slower than previous Ramadhan update. Also, pressing the back button, it reloads the previous page, while on previous update, the page still cached."
Luky G,"[Edit] Toped used to be the first app to go to whenever I want to buy something or pay bills, etc, but suddenly I'm unable to use any promo (including free delivery), so it instantly goes to the bottom of my list. I'll just stop using this since Tokopedia care doesn't care nor giving any proper explanation or acceptable solution. New apps keeps popping up. The top one will someday decline, and the new one someday will be at the top."
Purnama S Rahayu,"it's an alright app if all your transaction is smooth, but once you experience a problem you'll see the customer service is terrible (almost non existent), no email, no phone number, only message through app (and they can end the conversation whenever they want, to hell that your problem is not solved). also the submit proof for complaint is really buggy, I got thrown back to the previous pages several times, that's okay, I'm writing it again, reuploading again, and it still resulted in an error"
A Google user,"A great app up until recently. For some reason, the app can't load any pictures anymore if I don't use VPN. Tried reinstalling, but the problem still persists. Sometimes, it even didn't registered my cashback vouchers. I lose out on an Rp100.000 cashback once because of it, and the CS blamed me instead. Same goes for the desktop version. A lot of things just doesn't work correctly for me. I still love the sellers, just not the platform. Not anymore."
A Google user,"It gets worse and worse with more updates. One that bugs me a lot is that many product categories are missing when you search with a certain keyword. Back then when I search ""Dark Souls"" I can find clothings and a lot of other product categories in the filter. Now it only lists Gaming and Book. This inconvenience does not only apply to the keyword ""Dark Souls"". Now it's harder to find interesting product."
Tria,"Stupid update. A new navigation panel is very uncomfortable. There are only 3 menu on the navigation panel, the old one had 5. If you want to have loyal customers, don't make any unwanted changes. It's very simple, if customers are already enjoy the app, it means there is no need to make any ""weird"" update. People will leave the app when they feel uncomfortable."
A Google user,"Newest version (March 18th, 2019). Sort based on sold items options, gone! This is BAD!! Also, now? shipping method during checkout, you can only select durations of shipment (based on days of transport). The courrier company? can't be selected anymore. this is BAD!! Not every courrier has fast tracking and response time. I would like to choose the transport company that i know has good reputations. And Tokopedia took away that options. With every updates this apps become more and more annoying."
A Google user,"I've been a loyal tokopedia user from the start, i am a platinum member so i used tokopedia a lot. But the latest updates are trash. It keep crashing, going on blank pages, hangs or saying server time out. I've been tryin to pay for my things for 24 hours, everytime I go to payment page, it freezes, nothing to do but to force closed and repeat the whole process with the same result. I also cant see promos, it keep saying time out or i get a blank page."
Archita C,"The platform actually good. Yet need improvement, especially in expedition area. Which has to be more concern, because the shipment thing does matter for buyers. It needs improvement in applying free shipment methods just like the ""orange"" one. It is easy and has lot of choices and credible expeditions. And all clear so buyers feel the comfort to use best expedition they wanted."
Jack Olsen,"Need Improvement For Stability, UI & User Experience. I have use Tokopedia for like few years. I don't know is it just me or anyone feel the same, the feature is downgrading, it's slow to operate, frame rate drop, feels like you are playing a game in a potato device. Please Tokopedia as the 2nd largest e-commerce in Indonesia, I'm sure you can improve all of this just like the other orange e-commerce, I think you need to recreate & reset the app from the beginning / zero"
Amry Muhaimin Ramadhan,"Been using Tokopedia since forever, as the only marketplace that meets all of my needs, a lot of promos, and pleasing to the eye. But with the recent update, Rumah Tokopedia crashed, laggy, unresponsive, and user experience is not as smooth as before (the most irritating one: Scrolling through my search results, after I click an item, and then decides to go back to my search results, the page would take me to the start of the list all over again)"
Mas Dzulfikar,"Tokopedia has been my go to app for online shopping because I like how robust it is. But for the last couple of days, the experience wasn't good. The feature I like to use (search) has been riddled with ads, making its filter nearly useless. Usually, the ads shows up on top of the search result, which I thought was fine. Recently, the ads are spread throughout the search result regardless of search filter. A pain to use it with ads everywhere, making the filter unusable."
Sri Devitasari,"Been using the app for few years, since the app is easier, lots of promos, and the UI is much simpler to use than the S one. But nowadays the page (almost every pages) crash. It took too long to load the list and product images. Please fix the issue. Because having to update the app and found out that the app is acting snail-ly, when the user is at a hurry it aint funny. Also, aint the users especially the buyer had to pay additional fee for every transaction?"
Maulana Rahman Nur,"Tokopedia is my favorite marketplace. 1 application for many needs. But I have a problem about UX. For example, I search for smartphones and sort by price. Sometimes, the listed price does not mean the actual price because it shows the cheapest model. the ad title says version 8/256 new, but actually the price listed is for version 6/128 or second condition and that's really annoying. Can you convert it to a range at the listed price? So I don't have to click and go back again and again."
A Google user,"There are a lot of changes after the latest update and unfortunately quite a bad bunchs at it such as : 1.The UI are not as clean, fresh and neat looking as before. 2. So many bugs to the point it's often stutter and crash a lot. 3.To change what used to be Nice and Easy to Complex and Hazy, while the competitors are improving."
Dheeny Sentosa,"Few latest update make the apps very slow in response to user input. Don't put in trouble by having to reach you in other way. Just do the jobs, your UX sucks on some latest update. Click here or there, and you will have to wait a few seconds until the apps response, no matter how fast your internet speed are. And don't tell me to restart my device, I done that, and it keep renspone in slow."
Shugoki,"Additional complaint. Now both Seller and buyer were charged. Promotions are no longer valuable. I am no longer interested in Tokopedia. You may be able to compare my TKP accessing hours in previous years, and this 2 years. I use Toped only for searching goods. Original feedback. The 'Promote' list shown in the search result is VERY ANNOYING. The app doesn't help. Better to use mobile browser or desktop instead. -Update- Due to the 'Promote'-ed product, sort function become useless."
A Google user,"Once this was my favorite app. It's easy to use, works on phone with limited processing power. Unfortunately, it cannot protect customers' data. Millions of its customers' data were stolen, compromised and are available in the black market. What's make it worse, the management played down the incident. They even tried to deny it. Very bad handling. Even after over a year of the hacking my data is still not properly restored. :-(("
fathiya izz,"Really wish to support a locally-owned Indonesian online shopping app, but my experience have been anything but pleasant. First, I haven't been able to buy anything since my order keep getting automatically cancelled by the system. Then the whole mess of my account being suspected of terms of service violation (even though it had only just signed up). I tried contacting both in-app customer service and the official Tokopedia Support twitter account, but still having no way to fix the problem..."
Oil Up,"App is fine. But notifications are very annoying. And too many IRRELEVANT ADVERTISED PRODUCTS show up when I search for a specific thing which I have to scroll a lot to finally reach the desired search results. For example, I search for ""Guitar Amplifier"" but many results that came first are the advertised products, which many of them are irrelevant, such as hair dryer, water bottles, etc. Hope you can fix the super annoying and overwhelming ads and notifications."
A Google user,"Using coupons in their system and using payment, but they said it's not readed in system to receive cashback. Already giving screen shots of payment where I already choose the coupon. They said it's not readed in system. When real problems is why the coupon cannot be read at system. They have critical bug and not noticed it. Everything fine until they pushing selling too hard, and when bug found, they ignored it as customer fault. Nice job tokopedia. Nice job."
A Google user,"Bad experience after updating my apps. Many parts of apps don't work smoothly. I always get the message ""check your internet connection"". I cannot monitor my buying. The new apps always blames the internet connection. In fact, there is nothing wrong with my internet connection. Other apps run well. If your newest update requires the highest system of OS, please do make warning to so that we will not update our apps. Fix this or lose your users!"
Xmain 130,"It's getting worse and worse, there are lots of problems when I use this application, such as promotions that can't be used, unstable network even though the wifi is in good condition, complicated payments, and automatic cancel from the system. Previously, this application was very different from the current one, so please contact Tokopedia. improve the application you created"
Chris Yeo,"The new update where you can put several items in 1 page that has DIFFERENT COSTS is just the poorest decision. For instance: the title of the product is 40 INCH TV, and would list the price as X. Once you're in the page you found out that X is the price for a 24 inch, while clicking the option for the 40 inch changes the price to Y. It's just one false advertising clickbaits after another. Tokped is my go to shopping site because it used to be reliable. What's left then."
A Google user,"I've been using Tokopedia as my main e-commerce app, but ever since the ""racun"" update, everything becomes slow. Example, usually it took around 0.2 seconds to crack a lucky egg, but now it takes around 3-5 seconds to crack it. Not only eggs, but also products, it takes so much time to just to load a product, and i couldn't do anything (can't touch everything) about it. And trust me, my internet's fine, i could still watch Youtube with no buffering."
Afriza Aulia Natakusumah,"The ads are disruptive and annoying. They shove ads in your face every 2 items in the search result. It makes finding the item you're looking for horribly difficult. Couple that with the extraordinarily slow UI, it's a pain to use. Please fix. And fire the guy that has the idea to shove ads every 2 items. He deserves it."
Ivan A,"Sorry but it's time to uninstall this app, the service charges going up after just a few month. You can't even use more than one coupon. One more thing, i got a complain but the admin sure let the seller win, even after sending dummy picture. PS : it's not worth anymore to shopping here, the buyer had to paid fee, the seller also need to paid fee."
Abyan Albiruni,"Don't get me wrong, I love the app so much. But the recent update that changes the UI of the Bell icon makes viewing current transactions way too difficult compared to previous version. Previously, we could see difference between TRANSACTIONS and PROMO clearly. Now it's blended and the button for the transaction is small. Furthermore, all transactions are now blended as one, as ""Ongoing Transactions"", instead of divided to ""Awaiting Confirmation"", ""On Process"", ""On Delivery"", and ""Arrived""."
Saify M,"The app was excellent. But the policy/rule put buyer in the weak side. When buyer chose instant or same day delivery, this Tokopedia allows seller to deliver the item with extra up to 5days, for seller preparing the item (so, pointless delivery options) - buyer is loosing money as buyer need to buy the item again from other sources to get it in time whilst the seller does not want to cancel/refund the transaction and would max his right of that 5d. I was there and so disappointed. Uninstalling."
Choi Yuna,"The download size for the app is a bit quite small. But after using the app, the features in it have to download and that's almost all the features. Also i want to order some goods with free shipping for new users but suddenly the system automatically cancels them because they are considered unqualified, I wonder why did it happen. because I did't Using underhanded methods to get the promo, TBH I'm very disappointed."
A Google user,"Been years with this app. All of sudden, an email from CS came suggesting that some terms and conditions were not met in my last transaction and their fraud team's finding indicated that the transaction was a dropship. They just concluded so onesidedly and considered it final without even bother to ask me and canceled my benefit or cash back. Not a problem of their tiny lousy cash back, but just a principle of trust. So pissed! They lost it, so it's time to quit and uninstall this app!!"
A Google user,"Tokopedia undoubtedly has always been my #1 choice for marketplace app, my most favourite. But over the last 2 months, I can't recently see stuff on the wishlist, making it very difficult to memorize things and looking back what to buy before. Just figured out many friends and other users experience the same. The app lags frequently too, despite numerous times I've restarted/relogin after the update. Please fix this without us having to report one by one to IT support. Regards, thanks."
mahmud susanto,"It was my preferred marketplace, now the app is not as user friendly as it was, lots of bugs, like unable to change courrier even when the option is available, you clicked it but nothing happens, or worse, clicked it but would show the previously picked sub option, you'll ends up with the courrier you don't want if you don't carefully double checked it."
Lala _liveandlearn,"If I can give -1000 stars, I would give it to Anteraja and Tokopedia that promotes them. Why can't I change it to other expedition like the other olshop? This is a second time Anteraja failed to meet estimated time for my package. So annoying. Please make it so customer can change expedition. For now, si Cepat is better than Anteraja, but there's no option to change it just because we use free shipping (note that we can change it at other olshop platform!).. Please fix this!!!"
Rocky Fox,"I like Tokopedia but the recent trend of pushing people into taking credit is worrying. Why are all the best coupons/vouchers only available on orders that involve credit? I don't want credit and I don't need credit, so why am I penalised for wanting to pay immediately? This has nothing to do with issues about placing orders, it's a general point about the platform ""encouraging"" people to take credit."
A Google user,"This app has a great system that can cancel and refund our money automatically if the seller exceeds processing time, so it's pretty safe. One annoying thing is when I sort the search results, the app pushes recommended items from certain shops so it messes up and makes it difficult for me to sort items, causing longer time needed to scroll down through the items. I think the app older version was much much better with minimum disruptions."
A Google user,"Five stars for older version. The deleted weight in the describtion is quite a trouble. Checking by the estimated shipping fee? Everytime i clicked that, it shows the weight is only 2gr. So I need to go to the check out session to know the calculation of the goods. Choosing the courier also becomes more troublesome than convenient. Please do something about this. The layout is not a problem, but checking out gives too much work to do now. Why not make it simple again? I love Tokopedia, but not with this update. Good work, tho."
Chrystales,"I previously had no issues with the app, but I mainly browse on my computer since I prefer it that way. But now certain items are only purchasable through the phone? I have the app downloaded already, so this does nothing but waste time. What do you think the whole point of online shopping is? It's to be convenient and easy. This is literally the opposite of that by making me waste 3 minutes opening the phone when I could just buy it instantly from my computer. It's anti-consumer."
mr Jean,"This issue has been along the years since the past I'm started using tokopedia platform, the disappearing wishlist items for no reason is the MOST FRUSTRATING issue all the time!! Ever you wondered about when you are completely comfy surfing the platform through the website or mobile app (both of them) adding as many items as you want to the wishlist BUT for like 2 weeks later when i re checked it again SUDDENLY most of my wishlist are gone!! Like from 2500ish down to just 1000 items!!??? Guys?!"
Uzami,"[29 Jun 2021] Just update to lastest version. Previously after my previous review, there are improvement. But on this version, the notification remove my favorite feature, dashboard of inprogress transaction. Previously i can easily check how many transaction on each progress, now, everything is in row basis, and need to set filter. Had to say richer feature but worse user interface basic design. Sorry designer...."
Brian Hanvey,"My experience has been good till now. But since the flip to switch I'm finding it quite challenging. The point of an up grade is to present innovate user experience but this has sadly missed the mark. In sure to see the "" we are sorry for your discomfort"" BS after posting but it means about as much as the so called improvements. Ditch the dead donkey and bring back a usable UI. I'm all for releasing new upgrades but only after the beta testing has found all the many bugs System now cancel order"
A Google user,"It force to update because some features are not showing, but then it won't let me downloadÔºåso i uninstall it completely thinking maybe the problem occur because the installed version. Apparently the new apps really does not exists in the apps store. The wheel is just running with no end for hours. 38MB file does not take hours to download, right? Or maybe tokopedia got the virus, so its also in quarantine"
A Google user,"Now the user interface is just way too cluttered and less intuitive. Don't pack too many stuff into a single page, it looks like a complete mess now. I've been using tokopedia for many years now and pretty satisfied with the service, but the app's UI just getting worse. Bad UI would lead into bad UX."
Hilda Diana,"Really bad app, too much verification just for one account. Took so long just to change the name/brith/gender of the account or any self data. You can't access without phone number, it says that my phone number is already used. One word, too much error and waiting! Please fix it if you want to be the best e-commerce app in Indonesia"
A Google user,"I'm a Tokopedia user from opened until now. But I got to say that this latest updates is sucks. The apps always crash and force close without any reason. More over, the latest view on item selections is not too good than before updates. It's so confusing to see with all with soft edges box to differentiate each items selection. I wish you could come up with better appearance. So sorry to give you 2 stars now. I think I'll use other apps for now. Thanks for your service."
Amanda,My order was cancelled but my credit card limit hasn't been returned in the same day. I can't checkout the item from another seller. So frustrating!! Experience the same thing in red ecommerce and the limit has returned in just few hours. Fix this kind of problem unless you want the customer lost the trust!!
A Google user,"Everything is all good except the visual of your app. Can you have another version that doesn't have the current ambassador's faces on all pages? I understand that you engaged with them in hope to get the attention of their fans too to know your platform, but it's really got out hands, please acknowledge not all your loyal customer has a pleasant experience to seeing their faces. A simple pages with our local models would be enough for the other version. Thank you in advance."
A Google user,"I've enjoyed using tokopedia for the past couple year already and I have loved all my purchases i made on tokopedia. Unfortunately, tokopedia recently change their user interface looks and it somehow makes the application load slower, and (i suppose) heavier. I use samsung galaxy note 9 and the memory and ram works fine (as for the usage of another heavy app) so i'd say the error was instead on the application."
Dahn Andrian,"Been using TP for century, always be #1 option to buy some stuff needed. But, there is a quite things to have some improvement. The latest update has laggy issue, and something is wrong with the cust. review tab which not displayed the rate star. I have no idea about these problems were coming due to my cranky device or a system bug. And perhaps, to the tech team, please make a simpler UI version for the web-based."
Monica Devi,"This already happen for several version but I only able to say it now. Upload product, especially the picture have several bug. First, it rotate by itself not same as it shown in my gallery. I have to manually check and fix the rotation via app. Second, some of my pictures corrupted. Again, I have to check manually since usually not the main photo corrupted. Then I must upload manually again. It happen on Seller app too (before you said to move to the seller app)"
WisDooM,"Let me put this straight, the explore system is super annoying. Not only it pops up in feed menu, they're also way too many and cannot be disabled in setting. I mean seriously, what is this? Social media? Instant 3 star reduction for me. As for other features, it's pretty neat so i can't complain."
Rasu :3,"very buggy. suddenly special discount can't be accessed; everytime I open it, it brings me back to main page. after update to the latest it still not fixed. also newest interface is more awful than the last one; promotion page is just so messy and more scattered and random. sometimes the promotion page just gone when the promotion time started and it was back on again after the promotion time has passed."
sandi bayu,"more than 5 years since the first time using tokopedia then i feel so confuse to just find where's the tracking menu. the latest update makes me feel so annoyed to use it everyday. [ 9/9/21 - really appreciated that you make whislist & transaction menu button at the bottom of screen, since before only home-feed-official store. so it'll be more easier to find latest transaction n status. i'll change from one to four star rate. ]"
A Google user,"Tldr: Too much for my eye Personally I found Tokopedia to be very jaring to use at first, especially alot of ""in-your-face"" products and promotions compressed in 1 page. So far, you'll get the hang of it after finding your way and navigation once you're used to it. Coming from a frequent Amazon user, I feel Tokopedia can simplify further more on their interface. The vendors are also mostly sketchy with ""generic"" images from google + desc, making it hard to distinguish between fake or real."
A Google user,"Hi, tokopedia. My tokopedia application seems to not work properly during last few weeks (I already updated the app to the latest version). The first time, I can't add items on my wishlist. It keeps saying error. And now, I can't buy or even add items on my cart. When I click the buy or add to my cart button, it keeps saying error all the time. So I can not buy items on tokopedia anymore. Can you please fix this issue, please?"
A Google user,"I chose Tokopedia over its competitors due to its easy and simple platform design. But, it's getting VERY complicated. There is some info I saw once by accident and until now I still can't figure out how to check on it again. I feel like Tokopedia is shoving many unnecessary info down our throats. The ads are WAY TOO MANY, and everything everywhere is freaking suggested by them, it's getting on my nerves. Your shaking eggs are also getting very boring, please consider to redesign the whole thing"
Rifqi Elvanogi,"After the update, omg I really hate the whishlist section. When we open one of the whishlist items and close it, the whishlist section will go back to the top and we need to scroll down again and again. Super annoying. It was fine but man... this update messed up the whishlist section. One more thing, in the whishlist section, we can't select all if we want to remove all to make it easier."
Michelle,"Very bad user experience. It has a bug and suddenly-out of nowhere removing customer's promo without any consent or notification. After complaining to the CS, got no clear explanation, she only said my order didn't apply promo, while she clearly accepted that I previously SUCEEDED in applying the promotion, only to get the promotion removed due to certain ""unspecified"" condition. Both UX, technical system, and CS team are extremely poor."
A Google user,"The system is very weird. It's unlike the other e-commerces where once you checked out, your order would be safe even though you do the payment few hours later. But with Tokopedia, there was clearly some time left before the order got cancelled, but mine was still cancelled anyway because I didn't pay immediately. And here I thought my order was safe!"
Nisa Management,"The customer service took so long just to check the problem that I think it's already clear from the data and the history. Also the vouchers are weird, the terms are not as real as what it's been written. Meh I don't mind, the price and the variety of the price and stuff also are not as complete and cheap as the orange one. Good bye tokped Thank you for the fake hope tho."
A Google user,"frustated, every single time I'm browsing (i.e. search result) and accidentally tilt my device, the display mode change from small grids(tile) to big grid, and when i tried to change it back to small grid, my scrolling got reset! so i have to scroll from the beginning again..!!! please fix it. sorry for 1 star, i just hope i got your attention. btw, would be great if search function could search using portion of words (as an option maybe),"
A Google user,"Its a good app, albeit sometimes tend to be unstable but 1 major flaw is the ads, the intrusive godawful notifications that has ads in them. Im forced to turn off notifications completely from the app since 3/5 notifications that pop up is yours. Which is annoying since i cant see when my stuff is delivered or someone finally bought my things. Cut it out with the advertisements slipped in notifications, have some standards for god's sake."
Fadrian Jatmiko (fadrianj),"Yo tokopedia, what the F happened to your feed tab? It is now full of ads from unrelated stores (not the stores I followed, and more importantly not the one I'm interested in), so it now has this opposite effect on me not wanting to even explore other stores through the feed tab ads (like I usually do) and avoiding it altogether Also the feed tab is now auto refreshing everytime I go back to it from the store page or the product page, so it took me to the top page again, Idiotic UX design"
A Google user,"I haven't been able to have the photos shown on the perfect position when I upload them using my mobile phones on my advertisement. I mean, the app cannot show the photos perfectly. Instead, I had to use my PC to upload them.I did not have this kind of problem in the past. Another thing, why is JNE OKE option available in your system for sending a package to an address in the same city/Bandung? If it's not available in the courier company/JNE, Tokopedia should update the info on the system."
Mel Haris,"I strongly recommend for users to start updating their tokopedia app more frequently. I dont have automatic updates on since I'm not a fan of most app updates, but i just found out earlier that sometimes it won't calculate your promos/gratis ongkir if your version is outdated. Other than that, it's fine. I prefer the previous interface much more though :("
Ngurah,Tokopedia has always been a great E-commerce app for me. But lately the customer service has been really bad. They don't solve the problem and just tell us to wait and wait. I was very disappointed and it turns out that the problem I experienced is a common thing experienced by Tokopedia customers.
Faizal Azis,"The feature in this application is incomplete and makes me confused. I can't add a note for the purchase of an item to write down the size and color before check out. Besides, it was difficult for me to contact customer care, because when I asked for help, we were immediately obliged to write down the question in the search tab, while the answer to my question did not appear."
A Google user,"Using since 2016, I've always love how Tokopedia looks and works: Lightweight, informative, and no hassle for ""Click More"". All available in one page. Since their latest update, things are getting worse. Now I have to add some extra seconds to find the seller's display collections (Etalase) because now it's hidden. Not cool anymore."
Freakie Punchs,"Tokped going worst ever. Too much buffering on every single page. Too much Adv,make the app slower at react.I loved the old ,better. The most take my attention is transaction page,when i hit the ""detail transaction"" it wasn't show up,just loading like buffers all the time, the only way i could do is clear cache on settings,then after 2 times click at the product it buffer again and again.Please fix the ""detail transaction"" issues.Thank you team, keep doin great."
Roon P,"After the update, the 'feed' section becoming messy & buggy. Whenever I scroll to the next post the previous posts music/sound still playing in the background. This makes me irritated & annoyed. Also, I keep getting ads for products that I'm not interested/wanted on 'feed' rather than the usual updates from my following. Don't know how this app algorithm works towards its user, because my ads is getting more awful. And before your bot asks, I'm using android 13 on my samsung galaxy a51."
A Google user,"I have ever made transactions using home credit offline and everything was alright. But here, i tried to make online transaction and it said that i can't use it. So, I uninstalled it all over again. I thought after a long time, it would change, but my expectation was too high. After all, thank you for helping us."
Laelatun Nahdiya,"First of all, this app is great actually. Until i made my first order in this marketplace. I've paid the bill with the applied promo. But tokped cancel my order automatically. The promo was change suddenly. I have no any problem with the refund system. But the sudden cancelation make me dissapointed so much."
Asaduddin As Zanky,"Sorry I have to make 2 star. Because the tokopedia logistics is worst, and the resolution portal is slow. There is a logistics don't send my order around 4 days, my order has arrived at last point. the status change to ""penjadwalan ulang oleh pembeli"". But, I never to reschedule. So, please make a feature to review the logistics. The customers often give a bad review to their order because of logistics, and it didn't. the seller is at a loss."
A Google user,"Update: Now the app feels more stable. No more glitch after browsing a lot of things. Afer opening a lot of stuff it reset but for casual browsing still ok. The image load tend to slow a lot of time tough. Edit 2016/7/14: crash a lot, everytime I open 2-3 items it crash, very unstable."
D W Isworo,"Please provide facilities to rate and review cancelled transactions. Been running into sellers who put various products on their display and bragged that they have stock ready. In the end they cancel the transaction. It's not about money since the app also cancel my payment, but I lost days waiting for my items to arrive only to find that they will never come."
A Google user,"Error in the aplications. Please becareful when using it because it is contain bug, especially when using promo code. Recently, i complain about this, but tokopedia said that i did not enter the promo code (actually I already enter the code). This is really insane. If you want to use it, you should always double check it in the invoice to find wheather the promo (cashback) already state or not. Very disappointed it happen on me. I hope it did not happen to you."
Sally,"Made an account last week, got a free item offer but when I tried to order one they cancelled it because I ""took too long to fill in order informations"". And they didn't even allow me to order that same item again even though it was still in stock. Then I tried using new user's discount voucher, bought something, and AFTER I paid, they cancelled my order saying I was using multiple accounts??? (which I'm not btw) So yeah. Can't even get promos here it seems, so I'll see myself out. Good day~"
rijall connie,"Tokopedia now too many ads, too much loading and become laggy, unresponsive crash & freeze till I can't even swipe to recent menu or home to kill the apps. What annoying is when opening detail product then back to previous screen is refreshing new data. which then I have to scroll back to bottom and can't continue check for product in list cause everytime change screen it's refresh new data and the list that I found before is changed."
A Google user,The features failed way too much (like the chat feature crashed or wouldn't load or it would ask you to try again later but still no improvement and you still couldn't load the chat. Experience it for probably 4 times already in this past 2 months. Tried to uninstall and install it again but still..)
Deby Putra,when I shop with same day delivery. can't chat with the delivery person. and always the delivery point is always wrong in the delivery service app. can be up to 2 or 3 km. i know many delivery people who take the goods away. because it is out of sync between the Tokopedia application and the same day delivery application. I have deleted the Tokopedia application on my cellphone. I'm waiting for the application to fix it first. for now I trust the accuracy of the shopee.
anastasia yeruli,"Tokped, please repair your application. It's been a while that I've been using this application. Previously this application runs very well. But starting end of last month, this application shows a pop up message ""the internet connection has been disconnected, please check your internet connection"". Then i uninstall and reinstall the application. The application can run back to normal. But this weekend, the condition back to error with the same error message that showing up. My internet is ok."
Iman Prasetyo,"Hi Tokopedia, the current feed timeline is hard to scroll. Then on the post detail (Cek Sekarang button), the experience (swipe to next product) is bad. I need to see all the products title, images, and price at the same time. Better to bring back the old feed post detail."
Bernardus Kelvin,"1. Horrible CS, notification does not provide the reason of cancellation, only email provides the reason that leads to terms and agreement that is not stated b4 using the coupon. 2. Some discount coupon may be cancelled (/purged??) due to multiple user that has similar identity, cause its violates the term and agreement. We still lost the discount coupon for some reason (??). 3. Its really hard to track the terms and agreement for each coupon, and which transactions may lead to some violations."
A Google user,"The latest version sucks at its finest. It always asks me to check my internet connection when in fact, my internet connection is doing really fine. Furthermore, the loading time always gets me on my nerves. I have to wait forever after I click this and I click that, it wastes my time a lot. Tokopedia has been my one and only marketplace for ages, but this time I'm utterly disappointed in it. Fix these massive problems immediately or it is not impossible for Tokopedia to lose tons of its users."
Joanna McRae,"Still only ok. Unable to comprehend logic in ""ongkos bebas"" : tried ordering a 4kg product, discounted freight shown on screen. But automatic change of my order to more expensive cargo fee, no discount. So product would be more expensive than buying in small containers from my local shop! Naturally, that is what i will do instead. To offer discount, then disappoint, is bad policy."
Jeff Ongkowidjaja,"It's getting worse with slow performance, searchbox is getting crowded with irrelevant listed items, notification is not working well, can't delete old messages, message notifications are misleading (5 new inbox but actually none or maybe they are not receive well, dunno which one), and fees are everywhere."
Reinhart Wilson,"Nothing really good ever comes from the app these days. Buggy, trash search engine, sky high fees, etc. I can go on telling all the negatives for 24/7. Even the promos are stingy nowadays, and even if they're not, they won't redeem all the negatives of the app. I rarely use the app nowadays and moved on mostly to Shopee. Not saying they're any better, but at least their promos are good"
Andy Pike,"There are so many things wrong with this site. Chat notifications, not working, sellers just cancel because you've got a discount they don't like or just sending 1 when you've ordered multiples at a good discount and then just refunding the difference but not the cost of postage. It's becoming more of a problem to use then it's worth. Will be using a different and more efficient company. Tokopedia is dying a death, slowly."
Muhammad Irfan Dzikrirazak,"This platform starting to shows deficiencies, from lack of discount when it comes to buying goods, the seller performance that not as good as it used to be, the shipping processes experience difficulties such as take days to pick up and ended up getting sent to the wrong city, and somehow the customer service/chat agent not quite helpful. This platform used to be top notch (in my opinion), please be aware to you competitors, if you keep doing this maybe many will switch to others."
berlian alcaraz,"I ordered a tempered glass on december. it didn't came for a month. i need to cancel. now ordered a package, it doesn't show any progress on where my package location. it TAKR AGES!!!! TO LOAD. i want to talk to CS, it kept loading for so long. i want to see the sender information. it's ALSO NOT POSSIBLE!!! seriously?? fix this issue. AND I ASSURE YOU IT'S NOT MY SIGNAL THAT'S NOT WORKING."
steven,"Previous UI is a lot better than the new one. Update: can't delete chats now. It's just one thing after another with this app. Update 2: when it comes to transaction there are lots of system abuse to encourage naughty buyer. For some reason, buyer's still able to cancel an order < 1 hour even if the transaction has already been processed. Low quality complaint system that encourages fake evidence submission since basically nothing is checked for authenticity. #1 app for naughty buyers"
Kris,"The Chat inbox has serious problem. It shows number of new messages but no actual new messages in the inbox. Last message was few days ago. Refreshing, clearing cache/all data, and relogin didn't solve the problem."
Nikken Diahning Anjarmurti,"Disappointing Experience with Tokopedia I was initially thrilled with Tokopedia's enticing discounts and seamless transactions. However, my enthusiasm quickly turned sour when issues arose. The customer service response time was painfully slow, often leaving me without assistance. Their ""Terms and Conditions"" promised a hassle-free refund for canceled transactions via virtual accounts. But reality hit hard. After my transaction was canceled, I waited anxiously for my refund, only to discover i"
Maxmilian Aryo,"More and more features are removed, all for the sake of increasing engagement, basically enslaving visitors, forcing them to spend more time searching stuff. First, you removed the ability to filter products based on their category (electronics, audio, clothing, etc.), now you removed the price upper/lower limit. What a scummy app is this."
Ray Nast,"I lost my phone number, so I wanted to change the number on the account since I still have balance on it. But no matter how many times I tried verifying my ID, the system just didn't respond. Now my balance is being withheld and not one customer service seems to be reachable. Terrible company."
LyPhi,"The app just get more and more broken every updates for example now I can't visit a store right away from the Search function instead they'll search it normally and i need to pick the store right after that also the app gets more and more slow and unstable before you said it is my phone my phone never have a problem with bigger and more demanding apps like Genshin Impact or Wild Rift but this app for some reason just hogging resources, my suggestion? If it's not broken don't change it."
EWY,"Intrusive ads. More than 50% ads per search page A.K.A 2 ads every 1 or 2 item. What's worse is that the advertised item is already in the search result, making the item duplicates for even worse user experience. At least make the Ad logo more prominent or remove the duplicated item altogether. ID verification doesn't works and no customer support to be found. Note: if you want to hide customer complain's, maybe take out your CS awards from the page"
Zaky Hassani,"Has a web-based store, which HAS NO POINT AT ALL. Why? because every other step when using the web-based store always forces the user to open their phone. Why not just CLOSE that UNUSABLE web-based store completely and replace it with a link to playstore. What a total waste of developer's time and more importantly, the user's time. EDIT Jan 2025: Now they disabled the discussions on products. even less good features."
Aldi Putra,You guys please put back Notes (catatan) in the original position where we can put notes before click on check out. ! And FIX the unstable when running on Samsung 21FE ! So far okay but don't expect superior customer service. Sometimes damaged goods received and complain raised but Tokopedia didn't solve the issue fairly.
Alchemy,"Can be good, but also many problems. Many shipments go missing or are damaged or low quality and have to return etc. Not a very reliable market, from experience. Too many bad orders and bad confusing service from Tokopedia. Do not order from them, try another app."
Chiibi Chan,"The app & the buying experience kept getting WORSE after GoTo was acquired by TikTok. Many useful features are not available anymore while adding unnecessary features. THE UI IS JUNK, THE UX GOT WORSE. Looking at the recent reviews from other users, I can see that I'm not alone. I don't install other e-commerce apps (e.g. shop*e, laz*da, blib*i, etc.) as I love the Tokopedia brand, it's been that way for more than 6 years. But sadly, I think now I need to consider other e-commerce brands."
Marlina xu,"Lately it becomes worse, every time I need to complain, the customer service never reply, only one message at the beginning and will be ignored for hours, how can you expect people to use your apps if you can't solve your problems in your system!!! I bought a set of pans for 1 million and it was lost, Tokopedia asked me to upload my ID but there is "" Upload ID "" Option, only ""cancelled complain"", there is something wrong with your system and you can't solve it!!"
Nima Jine,Used to like this app so much. To the extent I've never thought I'll move to another shopping app ever again. But lately the app is getting less and less profitable for users. The plus membership barely showing any difference than regular user now. The minimum 200K purchase for 10K instant delivery voucher make it worse. Guess it's time to try another app now.
Michael Angelo Cosio,"I'll say this in English so every ""bule"" will also understand. Tokopedia allowing HOAX sellers, and they do not care if you lose your money or not. They do not have responsibility as a company between the seller and buyer. That's why it is only in Bahasa Indonesia. Seller can send zero items like tissue paper or plastics only through couriers, and it is up to the seller discretion if they will refund or not through their process. Gila gitu! The risk for your money to be lost is EXTREMELY HIGH."
Jusni Alim,"It is getting bad to worse on both user interface and user experience, and pricing also not competitive anymore The customer services staff are slow, lousy skill and not capable to a simple and basic analysis, many cases it was outplayed by naughty sellers. Bye bye Tokopedia."
Calonarang,"The best Indonesia ecommerce so far. UI is very easy to navigate compared to its competitor. Free shipping cost too. Got scammed by several sellers here, but the admin is very helpful, very easy to reach as well, not taking too long in procesw, all my money is back. Very recommended apps."
Faris Argadiraksa,"Search engine keeps displaying and prioritize irrelevant products over the searched keywords. Even when you search using specific parts number and code. Some system in this market place also can be exploited by the sellers, and I got scammed twice in here and the customer support says ""deal with it""."
El Rox,"Accessing customer service on Tokopedia is challenging as the ""Tokopedia Care Help"" menu is 95% managed by unhelpful chatbots, failing to resolve issues requiring human support. Additionally, the removal of ""delete chat"" and ""block chat"" features complicates chat management, especially for long-time users with numerous conversations. Restoring these features is crucial to improving user experience and simplifying communication for buyers."
Akbar Maulana,"Please do something with the UI, it's so unstable that it keeps returning to the top search results not to the previous search results. It's my main app to use for shopping and it used to be so stable and I hate the current app stability."
DMoon,LMy tokped app got blank in my phone. Then i re install it. Then when im trying to login app ask for otp. Im scrolling my notification find the otp. But page changed to pin in background without my recognition. I input otp and goes wrong 3 times then suddenly i realize page change now my acc locked. Amazing experience
Dhimas Arie Wijanarko,"Update December 2024. Much worse now, 3 star into 1 star. Seller allow to change courier from Instant to JNE without buyer confirmation.. even when I complaint, there's no way to get my money back. It was a 5 star, until it feels like any other online shop apps. I'll changed it back into 5, when the apps is not too obvious trying to get more profit with unnecessay insurance options and when theres a real person behind the help desk (tokopedia care)."
Matthew Wood,Lots of cheaters on tokopedia who label an item shipped and then tell you they don't have it or ship you the wrong item. Then you have to wait days to complain and the complaint process can take a week. The whole time your money is tied up. It's a giant scam and Tokopedia is not taking action to stop this widespread abuse. About 20% of my orders are canceled because the seller doesn't have what they list for sale. No way for non-indonesian citizens to verify age. KITAS/Passport not accepted.
Bryan Leonardi,"I bought a product here, I later had to cancel it because of wrong adress. They dont return the money to my account. Dont buy from here. Customer service is awful!!. Painfully slow to respond. And even if respond, they dont offer solution and just stall the problem. Tokopedia care my foot. More like Tokopedia aint care!!."
Lie Irwan,Scam apps. Show discounted price which is very inaccurate and missleading from the seller given price. On check out u ether get discount using paylater option or else u got a voucher they will cancel your transaction and go through with no discount price. Very unethical apps.
Jaya Sakti,still having problems with the refund system. there is no commitment to refund with a faster time. I have submitted a complaint to Tokopediacare but I don''t get any clarity and the answer was kept going no where. Shame on you Tokopedia..
Michael Nathanael Tanujaya,I personally think that Tokopedia is the best online marketplace app in Indonesia. It's quite easy to use (the interface is simple) and the support team was very helpful when I encountered problems with the stuffs I bought.
Fauzan A. A,"I can't to buy with COD method (even the COD method is available in that shop), then it make the stuff is more expensive cause I can't buy on that time. Is it a bug or I dunno? U should to clarify or fix the bugs"
Ige Fidi,"No better find other e-commerce, their shipping sucks and the shipping status not updated real time. Also their complain service not always available, i have tried to submit complain on 7 PM but it can't their service available on 10 AM tomorrow."
Yosua Bangun,Lot's of bug nowadays. I had unread inbox but can't see which ones unread. Also search feature in the chats has gone now. Lot's of misleading discounted price is anoying.
Christian Spring,"CAN'T DELETE MESSAGES & inbox always have (unred) messages icon.. Tokopedia ap often issues. Could u stop with the BLOAT, it's been awhile now with upper upper end phone & 4g the Ap feels so so heavy......"
Muhammad Ali Mastaji,"Aplikasi sangat bagus,, sering pakai sayaüò¨ Saya baru beli smartphone POCO F6, kalau pakai Wi-Fi gk bisa refresh loading page / kayak offline mode gtu, tapi saat pakai mobile data baru bisa refresh page halaman alias online. Mungkin ada bug. Hp: POCO F6 Android: 14 OS: HyperOS 1.0.8.0 Internet: Orbit 5G H1 Wi-Fi mesh: TP-LINK Deco M5"
Hanne,"I am a Platinum member. One of the items I bought never arrives. Tokopedia confirmed it, the courier took the item. They asked me to wait for resolution. It's been 80 days and I'm still waiting to get my money back! Do not shop in here, the CS experience has gone downhill. They'll not resolve your issue even for premium members. And their insurance is almost a fraud!"
Dominicus Ajie,"I just discovered that Tokopedia doesn't get involved in disputes between buyers and sellers. I really needed something urgently, but the seller completely ignored me after I made the payment. To make matters worse, I found out that I have to wait four days for a cancellation to be processed. I even paid for instant delivery because I needed the item sent out the same day. Honestly, I‚Äôm starting to feel like it‚Äôs time to move on from Tokopedia."
Dena Maharani,"This app got worse since the Tiktok Shop merger. The UI/UX is mid at best and search engine becomes asinine, it doesn't even resulted on what I actually needed, since there are LOTS of ads. Also for no reason, I cannot give ratings to some items I just bought. The orange app is alot better but then there's so many hobby items on tokped, again I'm so disappointed because tokped used to be a stable and nice app."
Ivan Dwiputranto Yososaputro,"Despite having so many merchants and products, issue resolution is very hard and slow now. Very disappointed as I used to be very loyal and only shop from tokopedia, now I shop more with other app as it offers better customer service and faster delivery too. Update: drop to 2‚òÜ as CS do nothing on issues/complaints. They called me but not giving solution. Basically just accept it and go on. My order was sent by shopee with 2 deliveries. Why bother shop at tokopedia then? I'll start using shopee"
Anthony Vovers (Tony),Great App that is being destroyed by over development and aggressive advertising. The search engine is so stuffed full of ads the product can no longer be found. Basic info on vendor has been hidden leading to lots of failed orders. Why?? 2 years ago the interface and process were great now I have to give up looking in Tokopedia for anything. Google search is far more effective than Tokopedia search. Though it tends to favor Shopee
IDS,"my apps still show 11.11. when playstore show 12.12, and guess what? suddenly the app stop giving me notification for whatever going on in my samsung. my notification fot tokped is always on, try to test the push notofication is on too. trus to clear cache and reinstal still no notification. i have to check again and again for message from seller"
usumikazu (Isti),"Overall an okay UI layout and I always go to TokPed whenever I need to buy electronic stuffs. But you do need to be careful and be selective of it, since there are some people that have bad intentions in running their shop"
random things,"i've been using this app since 2020, and the recent updates have been quite annoying ngl. when I search for a store's name and click on it, it ends up searching for the 'Name' of the store instead of opening the store's page. hope u guys fix this"
Fida Fathimah,"It seems like a race to the bottom these days with these apps. I actually can deal with Tokopedia's notoriously awful cust service and fake discounts but now for whatever reason they decided to scrap discussion/FAQ column, to encourage more shady merchants to stay I guess? Can't wait to see how else they will butcher this app further ‚ò∫"
Adamsyah Haryo,"Cant contanct with a real customer service, i can only contacts the bots, I NEED REAL HUMAN NOT BOTS. I DONT NEED IN APP POPUP TO UPDATE THE APP."
jessica t,Waiting time for debit/credit refund is unreasonably long. There is no solution either. Customer service is not helpful. Clearly subpar compare to other platform I have ever used before.
Sena Baskara,"Tokped, what happened? When you scroll down on the homepage, the app deliberately lags and you ended up clicked on the product instead of scrolling down, and this is not an internet connection problem. Is it a bug? Or is it a feature? A really stupid feature. 1 star until fixed. Hopefully."
Suprayogi Rahman,"Payment verification issue. Credit card bank confirmed the transaction. The app displayed it is still in verification. If the payment is failed, refund will take 14 working days. 2nd time in 2 weeks."
Valent B,"Oy, the video in the review section keeps lagging. It's so annoying! Before the update, there were no video player errors in the review section."
Francesca Hermijanto,"Their customer service is not helping at all. Just like a robot based on Ai, they're just getting lazy, they usually call to solve a problem now not anymore! I'm leaving this app for good."
Ryan Fitriana,"Many times the returned goods have been received by the seller but the fund are still passed on to the seller. Customer loses goods and returns postage. Tokopedia care is only a robot, there is no contact center for telephones."
Rivai Amir,"Too much bloat, fake merchants and dodgy deals(keep refunding payment without proper explanation) plus keep charging with so called platform fee even with failed transactions."
Alan Burgess,"Latest update has now caused the app to not work on my home WiFi, was fine before the update, now will only work using a cellular connection, please fix ü§î"
Mohammad Daffa Yudhistira,"I'm sad to say it but compared to it's competitor, the way it handle shipping is worse, my package come late... Pretty sad because they have more store and item Edit:item still not here, and the courier make mistakes on expeditions, yup this is my last time using this"
Marceline Warren Halim,"I thought Tokopedia was more trusted in buying expensive items. It turned out to be a horrendous experience. My item was lost, and I was told to wait seven days for investigation. After I waited for seven days, they told me to claim to the insurances, then no one knows how long it would be until my money is back. Then to take my money from Saldo Tokopedia, it takes another day to get my money to my bank."
Emma Taylor,"The app keeps giving the CORRECT address on the invoice (after I choose the address and pay and have zero control over anything after that) and then gives the WRONG address yo th s ller. The customer support does not exist, you can only contact someone on their FB page, and they give you a generic answer so probably AI. Literally unusable app, should not be in play store..."
Ary Prasetyo,"Latest update Agustus 2024. Chat button dissapear from the home app screen and no where to be easily found. The same goes with wishlist button, you will need to go to account first to find it. Counter-intuitive to already good and acceasible important features. Not smart."
Daniel Rev,"I hope there will be more refund option if there is a cancelled order other than tokopedia balance, i don't have a bank account and i don't see the need for it yet, i prefer to do transaction using common e-wallets such as OVO, Go-pay, etc. And the Tokopedia Balance withdrawal option is only available for Go-pay only and we could only withdraw and not top up the tokopedia balance, therefore it is so cumbersome to do a transaction using that balance even if the price is just a few Rupiahs more."
Gent V,"With every update this app becomes more trash. I spent 1 billion on Tokopedia over the last years and now I don't want to open the app. The made it so bloated with nonsense, removed very useful features and the app becomes slower, annoying and more cluttered than ever, completely disqualifying its utility. I just don't feel compelled to use it anymore. The UX team should be fired and so should anyone making the decisions for the app in the last year."
Faris Pambudiluhur,"I woul not recommend the app. First of all if the delivery is going to be late, there will be just another adjustment about the date and apologize notification. There are no other things to do other than that, which is suck. Why would they put a date if they constantly change it. The delivery service had cause more than a lot troubles and all i get was only thank you for all the complain i bare."
Ian,"I've been using as my go-to marketplace for years. When my package haven't arrived yet at the last day of shipping estimation & there was no package movement from tracking for DAYS since the latest gateaway, I am asking for help to tokopedia care to track my package. They said that based from their system my package has been moved to the next destination a days prior & the tracking in app is not updated yet. And yet, it DIDN'T updated a day later, then I file a complaint for my delayed package."
hero hartanto,"It takes a special kind of incompetence to create this kind of customer service that this app provides, for 90% of people who buys items here and does not encounter any issues with the product or seller, no issues here. But if you ever buy any 'insurance' from this platform and actually has to use it then bless your soul. Take my advice and just dont, take the L dont buy another 'insurance' and move on."
Anton Setiawan,"useless bait promotions price, displaying cheap prices but when you want to buy them the price returns to normal, and this happens to many products with red prices, and its not flash sale with limited stock, just stupid promo for new user but show to all users, very disappointing. shopee promo more trustworthy and not only clickbait"
Ray Ryan,"Since aquistition of tiktokshop the app become harder to use. It does even ""cannot find the poduct"" meanwhile it is in the list with the same name on the same page. Searching for specific product become waste of time, AI show you unrelevant product list of what you actually search. Basically waste of time. If it is not build by Indonesian and the fact it is Indonesia product, I will ditch it today. PS: I'm tokopedia user since 2015, the app was great for many years."
Yusuf F,"has the worst customer service imaginable. my orders keep getting canceled with the excuse 'canceled by the system', and the customer service just responds with template answers and then automatically closes my ticket. seriously, don't bother being an e-commerce platform if you're this bad. even shopee does it better. L rizz -100000 aura that's not so skibidi of you"
Satrio Pratomo,"The app's search engine sucks, couldn't even find the right things. Instead of only showing things i search, it's also shows things that are not related.. on top of the page. The website did the job better."
Ariq Adiwidya,"Always tells you to update the app even though there are no problem with the current version. it doesn't even tell why i should update, or even why is it mandatory to update. and even after updating the apps, it just look the same as previous version, but with worse performance."
Srinata Danendra Widyadhana,"everytime i tried to search it's always refuse to search, and even if I'm able to type it in the result is always error connection timeout even though other apps have no problem with my internet connection. I also can't share a product link"
Isnainiyah Hanifah,"Can't use their coupons because (as tokopedia said) my address is used in more than one account, which was later found was my neighbour, and tokopedia can't fix this issue, it's been happening since April I've complained enough, and they still can't fix this issue üëéüèª"
Islam El-Sheikh,"Looks good, but i hope they add English. I keep taking screenshots and go translate it to understand."
Summer LD,"you backend API integration is not working properly. i already activate gopaylater on my gojek app, but tokopedia didnot recognize that. i can still use gopaylater as payment method, BUT i cant use any of the voucher that needed gopaylater to be able to use it. instead when i click it, they just direct me to gopaylater page without assign the voucher, so annoying. is this just a human error or a fraud? oh yeah, the CS did not help. they knew they cant do anything about that, so they just leave."
Johann Syah,"update 23/10/2024: I can't give a review with pictures since the download always fails. this app is just getting more obnoxious. so I ordered some stuff from Jakarta to Cirebon, and I used Bebas Ongkir voucher. Now it's been seven days that my orders haven't been arrived, and the current status stuck with the same courier who was already in my city with no further update. horrible!"
Brand bradd,"This developer force you to update, if you insist dont want to update, an update pop up will show up everytime you click while search/browse a product.. the same damn thing appear in tokopedia seller app, if you dont want to use pin, an pop up to make PIN will show up so often. Sooooo fvckinggg annoying üòë"

Haven't had any MAJOR ISSUE beforehand with Tokped.. Malu sama app sebelah dong.. What a shame this company has become.. SMH"
Joseph deHaven-Smith,It works but there is no English option and they also have the app somehow blocking you from copying text to use a translator app. Same thing on the web. You can select English... But it is Not in English....
Dewinta Citra Sugandha,"I have the worst experience with the ""Customer Service"". First, they never really give a solution, they just told me to read their t&c without actually explains why my affiliate account got banned. Secondly, they never said sorry for their inconvenience, and just keep asking me to wait for weeks for them to ""check"" the problems. I was a loyal customer, but from now on I won't use this app unless they fix my affiliate acc problem. Might as well change ""Tokopedia Care"" to ""Tokopedia Don't Care""."
Apolonia Engineering,"Still the best stuff you can buy online but the new app is harder to use, please restore the old one."
Billi Andara,Where is my feed in the newest update? The new layout is way more inconvenient than before. Please fix it.
Hafizh Haqqani,"I'm sorry but the experience in the app has gotten nothing but even worse for each update. The unified payment method, the absence of ""payment total"" in PIN input page, literally the major thing has changed, for the worse. Please."
Haikal Munawar,"lately the search engine or the algorithm of the search engine has dropped quality significantly, it was really good a few months back, but this last few weeks it shows something very irrelevant to the user"
Atran Zero,I cant block chat from a seller. And it keeps sending me promo regularly even thoguh i already click stop receive promo. The notif option didnt help either. Its annoying
margareta windartari,"A pretty good online application for shopping for various needs, but changing personal data is too complicated, especially for changing the destination address for goods using the KTP address. because the destination address for the goods is not always the same as the address listed on the ID card."
Rara W,"So, despite all the goodness, you guys gave us voucher discount with a very good price, we use it for shopping, and after the transaction you cancel it right away without warning and ACCUSE US DOING MANIPULATION TO GET THE VOUCHER??? REALLY, TOKOPEDIA??? I thought you were better than this. People will leave you sooner or later if you don't fix this major issue. Also, don't tell me to talk to your CS, I know what you guys are doing behind the curtain."
Fajar Nugraha,"""improvements"" That's an interesting way to describe reduced usability, increased paywalls, more advertising, and needless UI fluff. If people don't want to update, there's probably a reason for that. Needing to actually force them to update is just another way of compensating for terrible design that fails to give users what they actually want. Forcing user to update is a FRAUD.! User dipaksa update, di paksa buka apps terus. Ngebet banget mau maling data. Fak yu."
Dony ‚ÄúA‚Äù Nuransyah,somehow if I'm going through product by product then back to the list of a products it will reload again the previous session which is I've been scrolled down all the way down üò≠üò≠üò≠
Teoh Gay Hian,This new update has some problema here and there. The most annoying thing is now the Chat is inside the Notifications. I have to press so many time just to get to the chats. With chat mix with notifications it's so confusing and some chats get unnoticed
A Google user,"why do you force us to store our credit card in your app? can't make a purchase without my credit card data being stored (assuming without CCV) in your sever. we; customers; should have the right to keep our data private, especialy credit card."
Abraham Prasetyo,Still can not delete my chat history and now I got notification for chat that I can not even read. Please fix it.
Adam Ghaviyasha,"My preferred e-commerce app. The search & product recommendation features leave a lot to be desired though, it rarely ever shows me anything that I'm interested in."
Shahib Al Bari,"Finally, Tokopedia listened their customer üëç. I always prefer the responsive, user friendly and no lag app. Their new UI app is no longer reloading frequently. I appreciate user friendly and effective UI rather than changing cosmetic. Keep up the good work."
Fel,"since the update, tokopedia deleted the status trsaction icons. The top only has ""inbox"" and ""cart"" icons. Hassle to check my transaction status."
Ilham Edwar,The last update cannot launch tokopedia app. Only blank screen is shown. Let's use another marketplace.
Poko Poke,Very bad customer service. The robot that confusing always come up with no solution. Real people took too long or even not come
Nadia Nisa,The order is always cancelled by the system with an irrational explanation on the grounds that I am one user with many accounts... even though I just ordered that day and pay it with only a bank account with my name (I haven't ordered anything in a months) and this seems to happen repeatedly
Michael Vin,"stop advertising FAKE promos, which lures customer into some clickbaits. You guys like to make items in directory much cheaper, and says there's promo. But when the customer is about to check out, there's no promo to be found. Nice one, zero stars"
Hendra Soerjawinata,"inbox is not complete, can not open inbox even there was an answer from the shop. so the discussion is not complete yet"
Surya Riza Putra,This app.. It's so dumb nowdays the chat often error.. Even the app sometimes show all store are closed.. Which is weird.
Abdul Kadir Jaelani,"Easy to apply, easy to use, fast process, highly recommended..üôèüëç"
Aris Prasetyo,Newest version full of bugs ü§¶üèª - suddenly missing some chats - all chat has read but still shown numbers of unread chats - auto reply from seller not shown in buyer chat screen
frank dws,"Bad experience as a seller, my store was moderated unilaterally due to buyer's fault, and there's no solution from tokopedia. We, as a seller, were just treated arbitrarily; while the fraudulent buyers (who received the benefits) got no penalty. We are just sellers who got profit from the margins of selling, and our business had been shut down. I'm really disappointed. REALLY REALLY BAD APPS AND HUMAN RESOURCES Unilaterally cancelling my transaction but cannot explain and give any sollution. F"
Zetsabre M,"Pretty good UI, kinda easy to understand."
michael deco,-a lot of Fake promotion from sellers they reject my order specialy from flash sale -Very bad recomendation courier ( JNE ) And Why it has no longer have option for deleting messege/ chat?
Goo Gle,Please bring back the discussion feature. It is useful because it provides more information to potential buyers through questions from other buyers regarding unclear product descriptions.
ahmadsat,"Broken app, i literally can't start to open store, they said i need to update the app and verified wich i already did, i tried twice from my phone and laptop, both neither works,, i dont know what's wrong but u better fix this"
Divi Mochamad N,"Something funny about this app if you're a new user they'll make your order fly to a different shipping destination address until it's almost a week late from the day of your order, don't buy through this app or you will be regretted it like i did."
S L,"the help care to general. so If I have specific questions, I can not chat with person but AI instead which can not answer the questions"
Alex Rybachek,Absolutely the worst e-commerce app I ever encountered. Just to make a simple order you have to jump through a bunch of unnecessary steps. It is impossible to pay with intl credit card and nearly impossible to pay with an Indonesian one. It has gotten worse with time. If you change your phone number - there's no way to spend or withdraw the remaining balance. Tokopedia help is run by a completely useless bot and they just randomly mark orders as fulfilled so no way to contest issues.
Fahmi,"Update: Bebas ongkir is back. That was super quick. Huge thanks to the team handling this. Here‚Äôs your 5 ‚≠ê First off, big thanks to the user review team for hearing us out. Love that the icons are back to the old layout. However, bebas ongkir hasn‚Äôt been available for the past two weeks even though I‚Äôm a gold member. I don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of submitting details since your software engineers are already getting paid well. It‚Äôs their job to figure this stuff out and get it fixed."
riza danishwara,"keeps glitching, has to refresh manytime to receive notifications. I cant even open ""Toko Mu"" page, been a week it keeps loading. It was a good app, now I give 3 stars. Please fix it"

Ivan Toar,"Slow, crashes a lot, heats up device, what a terrible application. Older versions were better."
Chloe Kobayashi,had weird connectivity issues when I was connected with wifi but not with data? this is such a weird bug and needs to be fixed immediately
Laura Rina Matiur Sihombing,"Poor handling of customer complaints. I order on Nov 4th, the order never came. The customer care promise to refund my payment by Nov 18th max. But Istill haven't receive my refund yet . I just want my money back, it's been 2 weeks for nothing ???"
Raheel Rashid,I wish it would also have an English translator feature
Benediktus Pungky Aditama,"update pop up so annoying, Updates are not important, but very annoying"
R S,Updated to the latest version. Found only blank screen everytime launched the app.
YAZIR orl korrect,not usable voucher still showing and automatically canceled by system... seem like a money withholding.
Iyxan23,Arguably one of the best Indonesian-made apps. This is the platform I primarily buy anything online!

Diana Lebang,Easy to pay. Many discounts and promotion.
Teguh P. Andri Nugraha,"Fix your app, unable to change ""etalase produk"". Seems like the app leaking memory after a while, hence unable to switch between ""etalase""."
Newbie,"Bad system, giving some discount but after we user use some discount, the system canceled the transaction and we have to re-add the product we want to buy. Dont bother to gave user discount if your system are againts the discount itself"
Vribble,"Can't read NFC on most Smasnug A series devices, while other apps just do it flawlessly. Horrible app to use for long travelling."
Fatimah Lazuardi Imani,"Please fix the payment method, it's really complicated, there's a time limit, I want to order but I keep canceling because it's slow"
P Z,"Tokopedia UI is very confusing now, I can't find top up and tagihan section. Please return it to previous version. This is very annoying"
anturangga Tantra,"UI is not as smooth as several version ago before merger. As of now, Tokopedia service has been declining over time."
Dalvizar,good ecommerce . easy UI and very friendly usable. but so many bugs for promo and slow respond CS make this app is a little bad

Ira Susanti,Can't use Gopay money/coins with credit nor debit card for combined payment (it used to be available as an option). Greatly disappointed here. Please bring this feature back.
Stranded Cat,"The app is increasingly bloaty and search results don't make sense anymore, they just give you irrelevant junk listings made by bots and shady sellers."
Stefanus LJ,"Since newest apps updated, i cannot find the Inbox tab. And also it's not user-friendly."
Dzikri Sahanas,"UI/UX yg baru juueeeleeeeeeekkkkkkk banget. Banyak bug kaya gak bisa scroll, sering kepencet produk padahal mau scroll. Hadeeh. Don't fix it if it's not broken."
Belinda Christie,Return the chat feature to the main page. Add a quick button for adding to cart without having to open the product's page.
Aline Pamikiran,"This application is quite good, but what is it? I don't mean to put it down, but I suggest that you don't make the price too expensive, or no one will want to buy itüòÅ, so I'll give it 4 stars, sorry if there are any mistakes, And thank you so much"
PJ33 get some help,"Does not support landscape mode. Inconvenient to use in tablets. Using the browser to open the tokped website is much better in tablet but with 'open by default' app setting enabled, the website suddenly opens the app when tapping certain tokped links. So I have to turn that setting off first."
SKYAPPS GROUP,This application service is getting worse and worse. I think it's time to make the company more efficient and restructure the whole top of this company. For a better future as the founder has already left. The old leader must change.
Lukas LOW,"Horrifying user experience, fake promotions being automatically applied (looks real & offered by Tokopedia themselves), and orders randomly cancelled if those promotions were being used (and sometimes does not return the cash spent for the transaction). And complaints are barely dealt with, if processed at all. Not to mention the ignorant behavior regarding data leaks."
widy,both selecting items and payment processes are safe and easy
Cie Wie,"Best online shop, easy to use and they no banned you for no reason!!! NB this stupid insurance is so annoying, randomly apply, even for some weird stuff"
Dwi Randy Pradhika,"Bloated af webapp, designed to squeeze every penny out of your bank accounts... It's too in-your-face, absolutely obsessed with dark patterns to trick users instead of providing a decent shopping experience. You guys are bleeding money, and you deserve it. I just pay extra to use amazon atm, heck even aliexpress has a better ux."
Tyan Hideyoshi,"Bad service, top up e toll pending, end slow respon complaint"
Muhammad Fakhrillah Abdul Azis (Fakhril),"Please fix your searching algo. Sometime doesnt fully showing list of available shops, but rather showing things doesnt even related at all I dont know if its because tiktok merge, but current searching logic very sucks tbh. Ads currenlty spreading on the product list, I dont really know if its really an ads or you just mistakenly put it as ""relevant product"""
classiclovertoo,"Earlier version was much better. I've never had any problem before. Now that I've updated the latest version, it's very difficult to check my shopping cart. ALWAYS message to check my internet connection / connection error. NOTHING' wrong with the internet. If I cannot check my shopping cart, how can I purchase the goods? It' so frustrating!!!"
A Google user,"Somehow the chat features is now works, Thanks for quick action. I am not able to make chat either to discuss or asking product details, it is always reported as error and keep asking me to have another try any later whenever I want to chat the seller. Tried to solve by updating the app but the issue is keep happening. I think it is a good time to turn to see the shop next door"
A Google user,"Front page sometimes display quick transaction on old TOPUP purchases with old no-longer-used number. As the main reason to click those is for quick transaction without filling details, usually the number goes unnotice and the purchase will be done on unused number/target. The help I got is just be more carefull/detail on next transaction though this is caused by their ""recomendation"" for easeness of transaction. Twice already with both purchase with no benefit."
A Google user,"Practical and useful. I don't buy things often, but this app really helps me to find things that are not available in nearest minimarkets and supermarkets. I noticed some minor errors like the wishlist stayed the same even though I had deleted some products on it. I tried to refresh it, but it didn't work. Eventually, I figure out that I just need to quit and return to the app one more time, then the wishlist will get back to work properly. Hopefully the newest update will solve this problem."
Faiza Salsabila,"My order have been cancelled by Tokopedia when I've paid it. It said that there's indication of manipulation. But the fact is, I've uninstalled Tokopedia for a while due to my memory phone usage. Then I want to use it again, because I have to buy book that only on Tokopedia, but it happened, and it's truly made me inconvenient. Could you make an improvement of your apps, instead of always sign up in the first use, with option login or sign up, so my problem won't happen with others."
Andi I,After app updated. While browsing an item enforce the picture to automatically slide. I did not ask the apps to do picture slide for me. How to stop this slide it's very annoying. Forcing app update when want to using it is very inconvenience but this time the app get sluggish after update. Done clear data/clear cache thingy but still unresponsive. Stupid apps ever made
Alvionita,"Usually, when I did transaction in 'orange marketplace' it's always easy. The app always detect whether I can use a voucher or if it's not, I should add order stuffs to make that voucher works . But in Tokopedia, when I tried to checkout my stuffs with cashback voucher and paid that it was okay until payment status showed it cancelled and refund with unreasonable reason of violation, like what?? And the fact that it was my first transaction in Tokopedia. üòû sad, but better say good bye. üëã"
Calvin Liemowa,"Still think it's the best online shop platform in Indonesia. UI is not as messy as others, not littered with too many ads. One improvement that Tokopedia can make is definitely the notification setting area for Android. The notification setting is just too messy with sections that aren't clear. It'll be nice to have proper notification setting so I can turn off which push notification I don't need from the app."
nafinia putra,"Various payment options made it easy to order, also status of our orders are notified each time, so easy to track. Super app to buy just about anything. However, the app itself is too crowded, too many irrelevant products on the homepage. Thus, I always use the Search functions instead of browsing through; I jusy wish it's more personalized."
Aji Purwoseputro,"Tokopedia fraud system is failed to identify customer transaction that is legal and valid (not fraud as Tokopedia system mistakenly recognize), and the customer service is failing to understand the customer's complaint regarding this. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with Tokopedia fraud system"
A Google user,"I think we should be able to filter our choices, like the price range, the seller city/locations, etc. It will be so much easier. And in some photos from the review, the seller change the photo! And please put real pictures only..! Thanks."
A Google user,"At last I installed the app, hoping it would be more helpful than opening the browser every time I want to buy something. But nope. The app doesn't function well. First time I tried to sign I couldn't get my OTP sent to me either by SMS or phone call. 5 times trials, I chose other sign in option, and at last were signed in. Not long after that I was trying to sign in again with no success attempt up until now. So yeah..please do something. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed."
A Google user,"[BUG] As a user, I'm not supposed to receive PLN/PDAM billing reminder/notification if I already pay for it. Seems it's automatically sent on the 6th day of a month without checking the billing status. [Update from 3 star to 1 star]. It's recurring issue, every month. Suggestion from CS didn't solve the root cause."
novalisna maenari,"Tokopedia is the market place that I like the most among all existing e-commerce.It's provide lot of promos, looks pleasing to the eye,easy to find the items I need,almost everything is available on Tokopedia. The payment system is also very secure, so no need to worry that money will be lost if the goods aren't sent. I feel very facilitated while using this application, so I don't have to bother going out for shopping. But, in my opinion the bad thing they only put chat service for discussion."
Prawira Adhimatera,"Why you feel the need to limit our wishlist items?! I don't think it will impacting much on your server or performance of your apps. I have been using Tokopedia since around 2013 (yes, it was web based only) and I already have thousands of items in my wishlist from researching for items before I decide to make the purchase. Now you put limit on it, I have to select the items to remove one by one. What a setback!"
Indah Ludji,"So it started when the app notified me to update it. I tried many times but no to avail. Then, I tried to reinstall it. Now, I cannot install the app. Idk what's wrong with it, but please fix the app. Thanks. Edited: After trying for almost 20x and trying the troubleshooting suggestions on Google play, I was finally able to install the app. Thanks. One suggestion though, and I had already conveyed that via the help feature before. Now that the Wishlist has been moved to the account page rather on the home page, users need to click twice to get to their wishlist. This is kinda annoying. Meanwhile, there are two shopping chart icons on the home page, which is redundant, imo. I was wondering if it would possible to bring back the wishlist to the homepage. Perhaps, by deleting one of the shopping chart icons (the one on the bottom toolbar, if I may suggest). Thanks."
Bima Atmana,"Experiences using tokopedia was good. It was good before they changed stuff for the worse like search results showing more ads than actual product you're searching for, the UI getting worse every update for example the feed that is very annoying to use, and also the way vouchers works now is very dumb (you can't use multiple vouchers like how it was before) and somehow after each update it's getting laggy and laggier."
Ivan Mahendra,"In early Jan 2022, i got notification to update my Tokped app to version 3.158 and can not access the app. When I tried to update, it got stuck at 77% and can not install the new MANDATORY update. I've been tryin for a week now, still have the same problem. Also, the new update I read is all about ads and promotion. What the hell, Tokped. I quote: ""Toppers, take note of all our promo dates in 2022! CantikFest on the 1st - 8th Jan, you can shop pretty dresses and beautiful phone casings from 5"""
A Google user,"Very efficient if you want to do online shopping if you dont have the time to do so or just looking for an item. They almost have everything i need from sports equipment to video game license keys. One problem is the price of the delivery. Its quite expensive if you want it sent on the same day. Overall, this is a good app for online shopping."
A Google user,"I change my mind. Giving 5 star for this app is too much. Being accused of manipulating transaction while I ONLY have one account and NEVER have I opened a store there neither violating any transaction across my history, is unacceptable! I used the applicable voucher available in my account, yet was accused as manipulating promo. The purchase cancelation caused me one-day delay in product delivery and messed my plans up. Compensation voucher is nothing compared to my time. Pls fix your system!"
Kelvin Arnold,"My packages are all gone thanks to tokopedia ""free shipping"" using lion parcel which is notorious for stealing people's packages and up until today i haven't receive my packages. They offer a refund which is not the same due the bank transfer tax, application handling tax, etc which more of a loss than a refund, it should be 100% return not 95% return because of the hidden fee."
Melisa Liviani,"Bad apps! I spend much time for choosing my stuff, I paid the promo with gopay coins, but the system just cancel my order due to tokopedia suspect me manipulate or having more than one account to enjoy the promo. Well I've used this for 4 years and this is how tokopedia treat me? If you don't want to give promo that way then don't give! Do not suspect people cheating with no evidence, this is very disappointing for non cheating people! This is a rude way to ask people spent time on your apps!"
IAMGOONERETTE S,App needs new update to fix some bugs. Scrolling review pages isn't as smooth as previous version. Please fix asap
Mats Tumblebuns,"After a few months of usage the app no longer lets me login and none of the restore options work - it does not send an sms or communicate over WhatsApp. And the number of ghosted accounts is surely on the rise as my wife shares the same experience, but that doesn't seem to bother any of the Tokopedia's employees, who are effectively undermining it's business."
A Google user,"Recent update to the UI kind of confusing. The left sidebar is gone. I can't find the Hot List section anymore. Also harder to find the digital product section. The QR scanner should be moved someplace. Can you please stop messing with the UI again, because every update brings less and less accessibility."
Ahmad Ghofur,The last update 27th Sep 24 - v3.283.0 always crash on Android 14 (Infinix Note 30). It works well on 2 previous APK version. Kinda pathetic for the update cycle
William William,"The credit card transaction having issue with fibalised the paymebt with OUCH! screen. The support totally not help, just saying check with your bank, while the credit card actually can still be used for other online shoping. And similar issue with credit card also happened in the pas, they need to fix at least 3-5 days. Very dissapointed, after become their loyal customer with Gold member, I think its time to say goodbye to Tokopedia."
Yanadawa,"The tittle of the apps was Free Shipment, but in reality, only Jabodetabek that got free shipment. Even though the seller was in my city, it's still use the normal charge of shipment. Then today, I pre-Ordered a book in a book store. When I already order it, I got a coupon for free shipment. Then I continue to the payment. When I pay it, the payment get failed because of something went wrong happened caused by the rule. And I tried again, the book already has no stock left. I've waited for long."
Nyoman Satcitta Ananda,"Too much unnecessary banners and ads. Upon entering, you will be confused to navigate due to the amount of buttons available. Many pages also have inconsistent graphic design. Fake resellers are very common to be found. Besides that, Tokopedia exclusivity on its promo to gopay coins made cashbacks less liquid. UI needs to be improved for easier navigations. Nevertheless, the goods and services here are plenty, and various payment options are available."
Form Gmp,"sudah mulai jadi sanget kurang bagus, walapun platinum level pembeli, tokopedia care jadi sangat kurang menjaga pembeli. Kalau seperti ini lebih bagus ganti agen dengan AI aja, logika lebih, tidak hanya seperti copy paste balas, tanpa baca. seperti agen malas, atau kurang bisa baca. Tokopedia used to be good, now its filled with sellers that do not keep accurate stock, and for something that is supposed to be delivered in 3 hours, it doesnt even happen in 3 days. If you can shop offline."
A Google user,"The only big issues I am finding is the credit cards Visa and MasterCard, they don't work.  I pay at Alfa Mart no issues there, when in country. This has been reported several months or more ago and still the same issue, their seems to be an Indonesian Visa and MasterCard not the real deal, but some way they try and scam details out of you by asking you to send your credit card and personal details to them. Of course my Banks advised not to do this, and some companies call this white listing this was out of the 90‚Äôs when the online banking/shopping started not 2019 were there is improved better security ect so business these days don‚Äôt need to physically see your card, again as advised by my credit provider so I would steer directly clear from this type of business practice, which clearly a scam. Their other methods of payment, the total amount displayed is not the correct its only about .100rp but doesn‚Äôt clearly state that when trying to use a token to complete a purchase and each time you attempt to cancel and return and enter that amount to use a bank token it adjusts slightly, on the same purchase nothing changed, the whole process is convoluted,"
tri utami,"I buy product with promotion code i got from my friend and successfully pay the bill, then the next hour it cancelled by system. Tokopediacare say that the promotion code can't be used by anyone, but again I successfully order and successfully paying my order. It never happen on another apps. And also i got my refund but not in full amount. This apps give me very bad experience."
Silv,"Too much nagging to be updated. Every click will nag you to update app, without the option to 'snooze' it."
SherKos,Sometimes the app is not responding and then I have to repeat my search and compare of the product list. And I wish the default of the shopping cart were all unchecked/unselected because I must uncheck and reselect the product everytime I edit the list. And sometimes I accidentally delete the whole list when I actually want to delete only few of them.
Customer Service,the best marketplace online shop. but problem when open the web based using PC. takes long time to load all the picture for PC. for PC user it's actually more convenient to shop because we can shop with larger screen and can see more items. but the drawback is the loading time takes too long. so have to cancel and back to android . shopping with phone is faster but the drawback can't see all the items have to scroll down and up due to small screen. Also the old UI was more easy.
captain jack's compass,"So, basically...if there's damage on the packaging or something else. It's the owner's fault , Tokopedia did nothing wrong. That's why we had to sorting out a trusted shop . Let's try to put the earlier aside, and take part on the positives way. I had a few experience on this, I prefer perfectly packaged goods and friendly couriers. Apart from that the average delivery time is fast. Plus, Tokopedia has many interesting features, and is easy to use. That's my opinion."
Archillez Onebho,"The pop up ads is very annoying. Every time you click, a pop up ad appears."
Maria Kusumanegari,"I used tokopedia a lot the app itself is good but the service is not. One day I had a problem with delivery. Clearly there was a mistake on the expedition company. When I complained it though, the tokopedia team just gave me vague and normative answer - almost like automatic reply from system, without really addressing the real problem. So, good luck using it."
nasich taufik,"Semakin lama aplikasinya makin gak nyaman. Tiap back page loading, loading, refresh, refresh. Ayo doonggg"
Grey Lienx,Ini Aplikasi kenapa error mulu ya. Web Page not Available mlu bla bla bla..
Akiyume Murasaki,"I have done several purchase through tokopedia. I never complained if the problem is not a big deal. But my last purchase was really a big dissapoinment. I submitted my complaine by asking the seller to exchange the product. But tokopedia gave solution by offering to transfer my payment to the seller. What the hell? This is not solution at all!! I did not ask for a refund but exchange the product, but they wanted to close the case before it was resolved. Really unprofessional."
Mariia Ilinskaia,Worst service ever. English language is not supported. My order was stolen and tagged in the app as completed so the money was transferred to seller without my confirmation. And that happened after two weeks of communicating with their support team. After they confirmed that the order was delivered to the wrong hub and finally lost and marked it as completed anyways. I wouln't recommend this to anyone
John Norris,"I am shocked that the system shows delivery confirmed when goods still in transit. No way of contacting tokopedia. No way of complaining until ""order complete"" button pressed. I will be uninstalling the app and closing my account once my transaction is completed. Shoppee is far easier and fairer."
A Google user,"The last update makes me difficult to use this apps. In every launch, tokopedia reported that I have no internet connection and requested to check my internet connection, whereas in fact my internet connection is good and I can access all network data and apps, except tokopedia. I cannot access my inbox, my shopping cart, and cannot do shopping obviously. The apps is now also sluggish and RAM consuming. I miss the old tokopedia where shopping was easier and faster."
Johanes Timothy,"Tokopedia seems to have committed some FRAUD in the form of clickbaiting new user to purchase a seemingly free items (users only have to pay the delivery fee), but in fact, it is impossible to purchase it. At the end, it is stated that the transaction is being cancelled because it doesn't fulfill the terms & conditions. This is such a meaningless reason as it is Tokopedia's own promotion. I have tried to do it on other device too, still it doesn't work"
Kurnia Akbar,"Just over month Tokopedia service was degrade. Usually standard delivery time only 1 or 2 days for lowest expedition cost. But now, maybe since Tokopedia offer their Plus membership, your order will arrived about over 3 days. Its looks seems better to using their competitor, same delivery time, but offering free shipping. In the past, Tokopedia is my only favorite apps for shopping, paying bill and also some digital top up. Thats why i still have the 3 stars for them. Thank you Tokopedia"
Sahra Yeo Weng Yee,"I think it is a nice app, BUT unfortunately, it was not open to another country. There are old tradition style kebaya which i really want to buy. Even I have chat privately to seller, and tried to transfer $ to the seller, the bank and money changer does not allow it (because they say country are not allow to transfer $ to overseas company). I really hope that Tokopedia can open it to another country as well, so that we can buy something that we want."
Kimberly,"Out of all marketplace my favorite is Tokopedia due to the amazing filtering, payment system, and user interface. BUT the home, feed, and the official store section is too cluttered. It defeats the primary image of tokopedia which have clean UI and UX. Hope it will be improved soon."
Hesti Hariyanti,"I did the transaction just now from 2 merchants. After succeed for the payment, and my card limit deducted. I cant find the invoices from my transaction. It said ""Menunggu Invoice"" Where are my invoices go??? I cant fill my complain in the app, because it required me to attach the invoice!!!! Please fix this and refund my card limit."
bene,"VERY confused at how this big e-commerce platform doesn't have a CALL CENTER. PLEASE PROVIDE ONE. i'm sure this has been a frequent complaint. problems are so hard and take so much time to solve with live chats only, especially the ones that are urgent. this app takes forever to load and has a confusing layout / UI system. really makes it harder to shop."
Mich Elle,"tried to shop here again 2x after a few months and had very unpleasant experience. terrible logistic partner, took 1 whole week for same city delivery. 2nd order with recommended logistic was supposed to be picked up within 1 x 24 hrs, still no pickup after 3 x 24 hrs. never had this experience with other ecommerce platforms. uninstalling."
A Google user,"i always love this apps until today, this is my first time trying the installment payment with credit cards, it says 0% installment and yet the bills come with 5% extra charge with ""biaya pelayanan"" rubbish, other shopping apps didnt charge for anything, or at least they do and telling us there's an extra charge for installment choice. transparency is what you need, its not what i get."
Krishna Kanhaiya,"Why 1 star? Because the customer service. Tokopedia care is such a disaster. First, bot responses are irelatable, second, the human cs is taking so lo long to response. In the end they do not care about our problem. They just stated how they trained for. It's frustrating. In my case, i was checking out a toy electric screwdriver. It wasn't like i was expected and missing parts. Long story short, i got refunded but only for the shipping. The real price of that product wasn't being refunded. ?????"
Raafi Alhadi,"This app is weird. My order history disappears without warning. The orders date back to the 2020s, and suddenly, they're gone! Checking the ""Terms of Service"" revealed nothing about orders vanishing or having a limited retention period. Unfortunately, I can't showcase the invoice cuz I trashed the email, assuming it would persist with my active account. Contacting support felt like talking to a brick wall in a maze, providing no useful information on why my orders dissapeaer."
Muhamad Fadil Sukarman,"EXTREMELY Bad ui, to many unnecessary pop-up and notification, maybe this is a bug so when i search for some item they say they can't find it but they literally show the item I'm looking for. So I can say this is a good app for shoping but the ui and annoying pop-up is the main reason I give it 3 star"
Kou Mirei,"Has always been my fave ecom. It's easy to use promotional code etc. However recently it's becoming way too stingy as we can only choose between free shipping OR (a very small amount) of cashback. I thought it happens because tokopedia wants our money by subscribing to PLUS service, apparently even though we upgraded to PLUS, we still can't combine promos. Such ""improvement."""
A Google user,"Don't know what's wrong but these days when I bought train tickets and use cashback promo, the ticket successfully bought, e-ticket sent to my email right away and all with no problem but there's no history of transaction in my toped train page even when I input my order ID. And the worst is, the cashback never transferred into my ovo points. Happened twice already. Very, very disappointing from toped üëé"
harya andhika,"simple, easy and trusted."
crsdxb,"I have been using Blibli for a couple of years, but had to install Tokopedia as some of the items I wanted were not available on Blibli. In comparison, Tokopedia is slower to load, and it's also a lot slower whenever I want to upload pictures or screenshots, and while it's not entirelty their fault, I've encountered a lot more issues with sellers on Tokopedia (e.g.: transactions being cancelled due to advertised items being unavailable, sellers not responding to complaints, etc.) than Blibli."
Eveline,"Promonya Oke Banget.. So many unique and beneficial feature on Tokopedia. I really like it because the payment part is easy and no need to pay any charges again if we transfer by bank. The report of invoice is clear and not make me feel confused. Once that i like is i can do payment with gopay now. Beside that, we can also be the part of Tokopedia with become a seller.üëç"
TacticalNudes,"The shopping experience is great. But the ""Bayar di tempat"" option is nowhere to be found. I tried to reinstall the app, cleaning the cache, relogin and nothing happened. It seems to affect my account, not the app itself. Can you fix it? Thanks."
A Google user,"So far been greatly satisfied using this app.. As a gold member I would love to see the mininum shopping limit for free delivery (gratis ongkir) coupon being reduced and/or the value of 'OSONGKIR' promo code increased.. Also, I would love to be able to use promo code for digital products more than just once, three times (maybe, please).."
Anggie Juli Asih,"Actually, it's a good e commerce until they establish a cooperation with courier expedition that is very slow in services and make it as their recommendation courier. It takes almost a week only to deliver small things in Jabodetabek. The seller is in Jabodetabek,and so do buyer. It doesn't make sense. Better you find another recommendation courier expedition or otherwise you'll be drowned with bad services of the expedition you recommend. I would change my review if you changed your courier."
Etri Dian,"Love the UI. But, sometimes it's kinda difficult to find history of my transactions.. I need to go to my account, scroll down until I find them. Why don't take it out and put it on bottom navigation bar? I don't use ""Feed"" though, maybe transaction history could replace it. UPDATE: still not considering this? hmmm"
A Google user,"Search function is a bit slow. For seller that has not been active for sometimes, just terminate and don't show them and their items at all, to minimize our time to search things. Some of the pictures of the items are dark, I think it should be reviewed by tokped first proor to uploading"
Gia Muhammad,"Brizzi account check always problem, unable to top up"
Adam Godwin,Did an update alrd but signal still keep on showing its having problem
Waundra Dwika,"Used to like tokped, it getting worse while others getting better. Logistics courier? Id express?? Tokped choose the worst ever logistics service in this country. It's been a week courier on the way to my address and still don't know whether i'll received it or not. Virtual CS? Discussion room? Really a big joke, loser!!! Tanya is a loser!!! No explanation no conclusion. Better you delete those useless thing. Last thing, 1 star is still too much for tokped! Let's go to orange shopee."
Putri Syafrida,"Tokopedia application is not good. This app makes a promo, we buy it, then in the middle the transaction is canceled by the system. it's useless. Apart from that, the menu display in the application is also complicated and the price is too expensive. It's no wonder that Tokopedia can't be number one in its own country."
Juni Fitriyadi,"Overall, this is the best marketplace app I use, but I have a problem for the address I pinned to become inaccurate after making a purchase to ship, so this makes the driver courier incorrectly follow the address pinned on the map. This happens when using instant delivery method. Please upgrade and update so as not to mislead the couriers about the recipient's address on the map. Thank you.."
Kasih Karunia Indah,"Good app, even has used goods filter. But, terrible UI. You can't even immediately access wishlist, and more importantly messages and notification while browsing for products. Rightmost bottom menu on the homepage brings you to transaction list, which is entirely unintuitive. Also many other annoying things already mentioned by other people in their reviews, like wishlist scroll. Please figure out something better."
Dani Irawan,"Everytime i want to buy/put something to the cart it doesnt let me. It says theres a problem with tokopedia. I already wait for like 6 hours to let it fix by itselfs but still it doesnt fixed. I already clear data and force stop, etc. And by the way, my connection is good. I was trying to buy a birthday gifts for my friend but the problem made it worst. Thank you :) December, 13 2020."
Niv Lek,"It's really getting my nerve when some products are not even available on this app but available when i use the browser. You promote youself to use your own app for better experience and this is what i got? I can't even see or buy some items i wanted using the app, only browser available! Why even promote the app in the first place if it's useless to buy something i want that can only be accessed with broswer? What's the difference anyway?!"
Cho,"After last update, the connection always timed out, i couldn't even search for anything on the search box. I thought it was because of my internet, so I tested opening Tokopedia with the phone browser and everything works fine, so the problem lies on this android app. Reinstalling didn't work. Please fix this asap."
Hesti Mulyani,"Friendly apps and easy to use. At some time I ever left this app, prefer to use other app cause there's many free delivery there. But now I'm back with Tokopedia cause the service that I experience much better, for example fast delivery including fast in processing the order, most of seller are responsive, free delivery, etc... Good job Tokopedia..."
Azure Lin,"I've been using tokopedia for a while now. It was a good app. However just today, I couldn't log in my account for some reason. I thought It was my internet issue but apparently it wasn't. It kept saying I can't login the account or error. It recommended me to contact the customer care. Which I did and somehow it also couldn't access."
Siti Humaery Farhah,"Each update feels a lot more like downgrade since the app is getting slower and super laggy, and some of the purchases only available for phone-users only. I'd say this was the best e-commerce for me back then but each update proves me that it's getting on par with any other platform. Hoping for some ""actual update"" and not just making the users lost their free storage in exchange for bad experience."
ivan,I don't have a problem with your apps. Since UI is more better. But i have really2 problem on your shipment recommendation (kurir rekomendasi). Never learn and hear from customer that you have been complained alot for your shipment / courier recommendation. This is simple things that make your cust will let you go and use another apps( even the UI is not good but have credible shipment)
Muhammad Bimo,"UPDATE (23/10/23): Can't search past purchase Lately the app experiences lack of connection stability. Just switching for a few secs to a different app requires tokopedia to reload and sometimes fails itself and has to restart the app myself. Also, too many costum animation makes the app felt sluggish, resulting in a 'slow' overall ux; took too long to load a page and heats my phone (S10+) quickly. Been an avid user of tokopedia since 2016, yet the updates brought none but my dissapointment."
Agus Triandani,"easy , simple and faster . Good Job"
A Google user,"It's a joke, the customer support removed my complain without giving a 2nd chance to comment. This will be my last order with this apps, not friendly user especially when you have problem to escalate. The tech bot also can not read my updated phone number and make me contact each supplier before sending the package. With current competition, they will lose if no serious improvement"
Luke,"I'm sorry devs, but.. Who in the world thinks that auto refreshing Feed page from the top after you access one of the items shown there is a good idea?! This is so ridiculous from UX standpoint that you should be ashamed to implement thing as ridiculous as it is now. Just try by yourself to access store that you frequently browse, see an interesting thing and then go back to the Feed only to find that you need to scroll all the way down from the top again. WHAT"
FE eater,"keep loading non stop , too much unnecessary pop up"
Faisal Amir,"this app a little bit buggy, searh feature sometime can't be used, bad transition, and bad ui."
Alfi Samika,"There is an update bug in tokped where, the google play says there is an update but when i update it... Did not update and crash the update and told me to try updating again, but it keeps on looping. Tokopedia pls fix"
Dan Dascalescu,"Please ""localize"" into English. Bali alone receives 10 MILLION tourists a year, so you're losing a huge market of customers with large budgets."
333,"The application is helpful and very reliable, it gave most of the details when it comes to everything, alas most of the time the UI very uneasy to see because on how condensed it is, as if the app doesn't give us chance to breathe. The app is pretty easy and very comprehensible to use, it has so much potential and it would be nice if we can experience the app comfier."
Kris Handoyo,"Slow customer care even Priority customer, unresponsive and unfair at return transaction as buyer to claim ins, Tokopedia may not refund Payed insurance Courier Fees at both side as seller and buyer, it's indicate that our transaction in the victim of corruption, this review may be revised as soon as accepted complemetry and satisfied solution at our transaction as caused by few transactions leaved with unsatisfied resolution, eg. quantity taken by Courier without explanation & etc"
Mikael Hadinata,"I have a problem with the feed, they are showing inappropriate items even when safe search is on. Wanting to reset the feed to try to remove them but guess what? There isnt a way. Trying to find a way to complain but guess what again? There isnt a way."
arkho ian,"Since the app integrated with tiktok shop, the UI is meh. Prefer the old version."
I Scott (Wild Runes),"Do NOT buy anything on Tokopedia!! This is a super horrible online shopping platform. Literally, tokopedia is useless, hopeless and highly incompetent beyond anything I have ever experienced dealing with any online platforms. Bought an item, sent broken by the seller, seller blamed the courier company which obviously not the courier company's fault as item was badly scratched and internal packaging was damaged already, but tokopedia shrugged it off!! It has been almost 2 months, terrible!"
Vania A,"Couldn't even purchase the products on flash sale, it's annoying how the errors keep happening"
Stella Kasim,"Very bad app, the customer service is robot , everything is automatically replied. NOT helping and solving nothing!"
stan hitoya or perish,"I don't really like the UI, feels so cramped because of the grid products display is not symmetrical and quite too many colors. I guess it supposed to look like Pin****st, but those round corners and asymmetrical grids are something I don't wanna see in an online shop even though they look more dynamic (?). Overall this is a good app focusing on electronics because you can find spare parts for literary anything and plenty of discounts slapped into my account"
Elliot Russo,Beware they will not refund you for delivery charges when it is their problem.
Budi Lim,"Failed to top up busway, but succesfull refubd"
Jo V,"They charge you for insurance fee, but the service is not there. The customer care is useless. They are there for nothing. Just to waste your time."
Yosua Samuel,"This application with new version (3.242) cannot using well and always out or close automatically in my device or my phone (Oppo F1S). Even, i do the reinstall this application is not working well in my phone or device. So, please come on fixed the new version to my device or phone (Oppo F1S). It's so dissappointed for me and feel tired to tried open and always close automatically. Thank you for attention."
A Google user,At first it was good but after i updated it the app works slow and is laggy. I wanted to change my phone number but after many tries it got denied even though i followed the procedure. It's frustrating to use to be honest and there's no point in finding help from the CS because the loading screen is just too slow.
Universal Truth,Cannot set language to English. Only Indonesian language so foreigner staying in Indonesia can not use.
Akbar August Indhama,Couldn't find the chat box button after the recent update. Please return to previous user interface
Odit Budiawan,fake coupons and discounts. if u used they will be canceled by the system. Tokopedia care does not provide any solution
Wahyu Firman,"have been a loyal user of this app for long and this latest update is disappointing. The search engine is getting worse and not centered on my keywords, I used to search for used item catalogues by relying on specific keywords... with this type of search engine that expands by combining related items outside the keyword into the search engine results makes it quite difficult for me to find the specific item I am looking for, disappointing...."
bambang wisnumurti,"Last update, notes to sellerare dissipear, it is difficult to communicates related to letter or number to ordered."
Edgar Veron,"It has one of the best UI/UX and accessbility! However, the number of some obvious ""fake stores"" have increased a lot lately. My search result been piled up with their listings and its been getting annoying since they tend to sell with outrageous price! I even have my listing pictures stolen. I have reported this multiple times before and the customer service wouldnt do anything about this. One time they replied ""there isnt any problem with stealing pic, since you dont put any watermark"" lmao"
Omar Sugiharto,"""Well Built"". It was. Now it has confusingly abundant features that render us motionless to surf around. Incredibly heavy, be it judged from its size or its requirement to run. Simplicity seems like not in the app's current vocabulary. Either the developer put too much effort or the management made too many request judging by its look."
Agung Damas,The app has been unstable lately
A Google user,"Very dissapointing. I'm having a hard time by changing numbers in my account. Also there's a bug everytime u transferred for top up e-toll card, suddenly u can't check the balance through nfc. I thought it wasn't a problem, but then, i can't use my e-toll card because the balances aren't updated unless i rescan nfc, which cannot be undone by this bug."
Dewi Setyawati Putri,"Change the stars from 5 to 2, disappointed with the complain and return process. The expedition failed to pick up after waiting for more than 6 hours, and then Tokopedia only gave me 24 hours, outside of working days, to have the item manually dropped to the expedition. Such a hassle, the orrange and blue apps give better service for return process than this green apps."
reecheese,"i don't have problems with tokopedia at all. compare to other online shop platform, i think tokopedia not spend too much in my handphone memory, the features is just simple! and i love that. just maybe if tokped add feature more specific on a shop 'searching product category' and oblige buyers to give a review with picture+video, so other who still feel doubt to buy 'that product' will have more interest and more convince to buy!"
Pingky,"Functionality doesnt differ much from dekstop website. So this rating is strictly for the app. Super annoying popups that doesnt have a ""skip all"", there's only ""next"". Need to add ""do not show this again"" for the tokopedia pin set up bc i had enough protection for logins. No clear feature for app search bar that is not related to products searching. Would be better if you add those so we cn search certain settings easier. Where the heck is english language for this app?"
The Gambler,"Toped used to be the first app to go to whenever I want to buy something or pay bills, etc, but suddenly I'm unable to use any promo (including free delivery), so it instantly goes to the bottom of my list. I'll just stop using this since Tokopedia care doesn't care nor giving any proper explanation or acceptable solution. New apps keeps popping up. The top one will someday decline, and the new one someday will be at the top. the system is very bad, especially in tokopedia care and resolution."
A Google user,"I am living in the US, so I was using my US phone number yesterday to create an account with them. Everything was smooth until it become a nightmare. Just right after I made a transaction, it immediately got canceled and the fund deposited into my account. I failed to place the same transaction again, and later failed to withdraw, as they kept challenge me with an OTP sent to my US phone number that I never received. I will report to Google this app as scam if they fail to refund my money back."
Ocha Lambana,"Been months since I posted the last rating. Nothing has changed.Every single day I still have to receive confirmation via sms just to confirm for wakaf transaction because it says there's an error.Looking at stuffs also frequently freezes. NOW...I can't even click on my transactions to check on them.The screen simply freezes,so I have no idea how to track them or even make cancelation or changes.Internet is ok. This used to be my app to go. Now, I'm thinking of switching to another e-commerce."
Herman Sudjati,"I m quite happy with apps except for return goods to seller and for payment refund. It creates lots of inconvenient to buyer as buyer has to send the goods to seller. Suggest that Toped should initiate the pick up. Another point that is frustratating is method of payment, for unkown reason, there is no method of payment available for using credit card. Please note, I have no problem with my credit card. This is only happening recently. It seem that Toped is striving to direct n coerce customer"
Hilmikk,"There are some areas where improvements can be made, such as inconsistencies in the user interface, performance issues, and suboptimal features."
Sita .Hatmosroyo,I've been using Tokopedia for years and Alhamdulillah every transactions went smoothly. There were some moments less than perfect but they weren't too much of a bother to me. All of the unpleasant experiences came from the not so good people that sell their goods in Tokopedia and not from Tokopedia itself. I hope Tokopedia will continue to be the #1 marketplace in Indonesia and be more successfull in the future.
Paula Halim Ong,"Hi Tokopedia, it has been 2 days i have been trying to use the applications, and it keeps saying no internet connection, while other applications are working fine without same issue. I have tried to switch from using wifi and mobilr network and it is still the same. I have updated to newer version, issue still there. Would you please fix it asap. Thank you"
Jush,INSTALLING UPDATE TIL FOREVER. FIX YOUR LAST UPDATE. IT STOPPED WORKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Stephen Rajaratnam,"Times have changed. The apps can highlight my request and activate auto payment without my consent. When complain they are always right and don't resolve the issue. They do not cancel the subscription but i have to do, yet after hours still cannot find unsubscribe. Apps has learnt tricky methods that can subscribe on its own."
Muhammad Rizal Zulmi,"Please jangan masukin inbox ke notification. We don't care about general notification, but we ARE CONCERNED about inbox. Please lah. Balikin inbox di homepage."
Ryanto Ryanto,"been using the app for years, but the experience getting really bad lately. especially when searching for items. the ads are annoying, to the point that you will see the SAME ads between 3-4 items on the list. not to mention, when clicking on wishlist items, it will reload everytime you get back to the wishlist."
Erna Firdaus,"It's been 3 days the app not working, it keeps logging out and not possible to log in. Literally I've tried everything the Tokopedia Care suggested. The app is up to date, google play service is up to date, internet connection is fine both Wi-Fi and mobile network, reinstalled the app few times. I was able to open it for a moment then it's not working again. I am not the only one apparently, from seeing the reviews recently. Update: it's back on track as usual, keep up the good work Tokopedia."
A Google user,"Rather than changing the interface everytime we update, I personally think, it'd be much better if you add some filter to the search. Because the key words are too general, sometimes it's hard to find specific things because the words keep lapping. Thanks"
A Google user,"Oftentimes a little confusing with all the features and buttons, sales and whatnot. But after a bit of adjusting, I'm getting used to it somewhat. Discounts and cashbacks can be very luring and convenient due to its collab with OVO. I don't quite appreciate the many notifications especially in the middle of the night. But overall it's a great platform. Payment system is flexible and safe. My favourite online-shopping platform for now :D"
A Google user,"This program is very useful when you want to buy somethjng from online shop.. It has many categories.. even the healthy toys sold in this application. But need more improving on delivery tracking, sometimes the maps got stuck and not moving.. and the driver already arrived at the destination but on the maps, the driver still far away. Overall this application is the best."
Stella Katherine,"I have relied on Tokopedia to obtain from cheap and mundane items to pricy gadgets that need extra care in handling and shipping. I am satisfied (so far) with its choice of stores, couriers, user-friendly design and system. Sometimes, Tokopedia issues coupons that allow you to cut on shipping fees, among others, to the point of free. I have no complain yet and thus have never needed to contact its customer service, so I cannot review on this part. Hopefully it won't need to happen :)"
A Google user,"I don't like the sound of the notification of Toped, I already try to turn off the notification but why still turn on and the sound really disturb me when I'm in the office, all people always judge me that I'm busy to buy something through Toped, even I'm not do it, it's because the sound of the notification. How can I turn off the notification??!"
Ferry Aryan,"Now this app is not recommended for payment or top up, the respon very slow and contact service just answer our complain like a n automatic answering machine. But it's still ok for online shop. Again, problem with expedition partner. No wonder if this apps never reach top 3 in shopping category. No improvement at all!!"
Devy Rosady,"Lately can not sign into my Tokped account, and everytime try to sign in always said that ""No internet connection"" but ny network is fine and other apps no problem at all. Done couple time uninstall and reinstall. The problem keep occurs, please resolve this issue. Already tried to do many solution but the problem keep comes up saying no internet connection and can not log into my Tokped account. Fix bugs on the new update please.. overall before the problem occurs, I can rate at least 4 stars"
danny tanoto,"My biggest problem with this app isnt the seller but the tokopedia's policy and sistem itself. They are probably thousands of seller. Some of them are legit but some are not. And its tokopedia's job duty and responibility to filter, to take certain strict action to seller on behalf of the customer. But customer is ALWAYS on the losing side while tokopedia persistently to close the problem without any solution. If i were giving an opt, i rather not shops thru tokopedia."
Timothy Michael,"Im Satisfied enough with All the Feature, But its still Can Be More Better and Better. It Just Like a Simple Add and Fixing Previous Feature. Of course there is Critics and Suggestions about the Feature that already In The App which is A Big Help for the Developer Team!. Keep up the Good work and Im Hope there is a lot of improvement in the future üëç"
Gerald W,"Tokopedia can be a great app if access is not limited to its own country. I have an account registered under my Indo number and its associated with email. However, the only way to login is through OTP from indo number. This makes it hard when I'm constantly travelling. When attempting to login via email, I was also blocked by phone OTP. There should be other methods of OTP given that this app is reputable. Because of that, this app deserves a 1 star. Hopefully, there will be future enhancement."
A Google user,"Very easy to use and so helpful. I love it, cause there's so many voucher and discount every time when I want to shopping. Anyway, I'm green lovers. And, Tokopedia have the green color as it's trademark. Thanks for everything and everytime."
andy rosady,"When it comes to complaint, tokopedia cant give any fast solution, investigation took days, i paid, but i havent get anything from the seller, and tokopedia solution is 'WAIT' its been almost 2 weeks since i paid, and nothing from the seller or tokopedia. It seems like tokopedia is giving the seller a better service than the buyer. Update june 11th,2020. My complaint havent been resolved. from my point of view, the obstacle is tokopedia doesnt care for their buyer's difficulties."
A Google user,"Buyers paid in advance but some of the seller just ignored the order and even sent messages saying we don't have the item anymore and not rejected the order. It happens because they are allowed to and forced the buyer waiting until the order expired. You should've forces your seller to accept or reject orders first the very second they logged in, it's an awful feeling knowing you have paid in advance, neglected and forced to wait more due to a flaw in the procedure. It happens to me twice now"
A Google user,"I love the application itself. it user-friendly and light to use. But the thing I cant understand is why Tokopedia didnt have any number for user to reach customer service. it hard to reach a live customer service by only using a chat. since our ticket like coming to a queue and waiting any respond, and it might take time to be responded. it is not good and not a solution for one of biggest marketplace apps in Indonesia. you guys should have a feature to call customer service through the apps."
Muhammad Thoha Akhyaru Ilyas,"Tokopedia used to provide smooth and great experience to its users. However, these days, the app goes heavily to load and even its competitor like the orange one which has a bunch of non-essential features is faster than Tokopedia. I hope you guys could fix this experience."
Lamer Lamer,So far i like to use tokopedia to buy or to sell than any other marketplace. Because tokopedia's fiture are simply and easy to use. But one thing that i don't like it the most is on the fiture in searching. After upload new product mostly not come directly in seach results. And seems the developer make function 'like%' not '%like% function. So any character comes before the seach key will not come.
iYal Aristama,"If there is a case like broken product, seems like Tokopedia backs the seller instead of customer. It gives opportunity to seller to sell broken product again and again since they know that tokped system give advantage to them, especially for cheap product under 50k. They command me to send broken product back to seller if I am not satisfied, like what the... , I have to go to expedition courrier agency just for 15K stuff, wasting time and wasting money for parking."
A Google user,"Still my #1 online shopping app, so much more convenient to shop for my household needs, my kids needs, bills, etc so I can have extra time with my family instead of going around doing traditional shopping and queuing at the cashier counter. One more wish from me to Tokopedia is to enable us to organise the wishlist (folders/categorise by products/sellers) since I have tons of regular products to buy. Thanks!"
Baskara Putra,"Very convenient and best shopping apps I've used. Great and innovative services. They add more transaction option from my review (permata Bank) and i love it. Please make it compatible with tablet devices, especially for landscape mode. Maybe keeping it potrait, but adjustable for landscape by making a white frame in it's left and right. Or better yet, no frame and fully landscape"
Sakura Mochi,"This apps can be used easily.. But maybe need improvement for search & filter. Sometimes it display too much promote items and combine with the one I search for.. So its hard to find the items I really want. But so far, the apps already better than before"
A Google user,"Tokopedia was very good until they cant manage my problems very well. So this is the story, i bought a book, i choose free delivery (its a big deal for me) that shipped by anteraja. Pitty, my book never arrive although i got notif that book already arried. I complain, tokped decide to refund my money. But the money never come. I try to send the problems 2 times. And i decide to install and give bad rating to this app. I also will not recommend this app cause my experiences. Sincerely Ur ex"
A Google user,"Too much crashing and server problem. Tokopedia was good, it was simply a buy and sell site, very convenient. Now Tokopedia's so busy, annoying 'play' invitation, inbox spamming with official messages and other shops messages, i wish you erase all of those and get back to the 'vintage' Tokopedia that offer cozy marketplace where we could buy and sell. Your useless annoying new features bring no good but HEAVY BURDEN for your server and our smartphones. Please keep it simple like it used to be."
A Google user,"Here's my opinion on tokopedia after being it's costumer for about 2 years. 1. The system never goes down therefore its so reliable. 2. Relatability of it's product with my preference's is nice. 3. We often see stores with good atitude merchant, fast respon, and profesional product description. that's all, hope you guys keep the good job!"
Andrew Tandusan,"I used Tokopedia for more than 5 years and I decided to drop the rate from 5 to 3 stars because since the last update I can't see the weight of my purchasing stuff, not like before update, it makes me have to guess. It means a lot to me because i'm live in countryside. Please add again the weight for every stuff in the delivery page. Sorry about that, and I hope it can be fixed. Thank you."
Susy S,"For products with varian, please show the main photo instead of the photo of the first product in the varian. It misleads the customers, as one of my customers said she couldn't find my products because she only scroll through the page. The varian only appears when the user clicks the photo, but how would they know if the products have varian inside if they didn't click? Please take a look at 'toko sebelah' on how to show products varian."
Fadilah Muh. Abdurrahman,"Used to be my go-to app for online shopping, until very recently, it asked me for verification when I wanted to buy pods because it constituted as an ""adult"" item. Granted, it's good that they make an effort to prevent underaged people buying cigarettes and the like, but the verification system is ridiculous. Not only they ask for an ID card, but also take a selfie. This is the sort of thing you can expect from state-owned apps, not Tokopedia. Don't use this if you care about privacy."
David FX,"Your ads is getting out of hand. Furthermore it comes with random and unrelated products, it feels useless to follow favorite shop if you can see their updates because of your force random ads. Seriously it sucks. Please kindly reconsider to bring back your efficient commerce platform it's been laggy. Please don't become like crowded marketplace, it makes user uncomfortable. Tokopedia, you're better than this."
In_ Prime 44,"User friendly app, and it's good to see it have an pay on delivery (COD) but the minimum purchase make it reduce the feature itself, no wonder the other e commerce competitor still a favorite among the e commerce users without a minimum purchase. Hope you can fix it on the future update."
A Google user,"Hi, my name is alwi this application is very good, trustworthy. But there is an inaccurate about the location or the location is not according to the original, for example, I live in the hamlet of Banaran, Besole, Besuki Fogapen, Tulungagung, East Java Province, but on the map of Pedia, it is written Gambiran Village, Besole, Besuki, Tulungagung, East Java. please fix this problem, thank you"
Muhammad Irvan,"Sorry for the 1 star rating however there's a fatal flaw in this app. I lost Rp400.000 ($27.85 with current exchange rate of $1 = Rp14.362,05) in my last purchase. It may not much but for the average joe here it's alot. I already transferred my money to the virtual billing account for my purchase and no confirmation from Tokopedia and the transferred money is lost and my Tokopedia Balance hasn't change. Please fix this problem immediately before this happen again to another person. Thank you"
sha,"Back then at 2017 I gave this app 2 stars rating because the app was so buggy I couldn't even log in to the app. Now in 2020, this app become my go-to e-commerce app. I admit the BEBAS ONGKIR got me (please don't ever remove this promo), but beside that I love how easy and clean the UI/UX in here, also the wishlist feature is my fave (you don't want to know how many inside my wishlist rite now). Overall I can see that this app is improving a lot. Keep doing good job Tokopedia team!"
Ronny Robertus,"Your newest apps sucks! And there is no online customer service center that could be called. Everything must be done via messenger which doesn't resolve the problem. out of no where I couldn't pay using credit card like usual. The pages freezed and didn't display the details of payment nor the type credit card to be used. When I message your CS, they said nothing wrong with the apps. Not helpful at all"
No Subscribers,"First, there's no notifications cleaner. So, don't get mad if you got tons of notifications in almost every hour. They just left there like garbage. Second, turning off notification options doesn't mean you will stop receiving them. Please do something to stop this freaking. Most of them are irrelevant to user's choice."
Wibisana Larasati,Worst verification system ever for returning user. SMS number for OTP never meant to be reached with whatsoever device's setting in this A37F that didn't filter the Tokopedia's automated message. Another heinous alternate is to upload personal ID and a transaction evidence cannot be chosen one of these opts. Uninstall.
cicillia salim,"These past few months, there are 3 annoying issues with your app. 1, On several occasions, I cannot see stores content.. 2, After update suddenly there are pending items waiting for my review. Whilst I made the review months and months ago.. 3, the most annoying one. I made purchase, app confirm the payment.. and I have notification that I have pending payment. I am contacting your TokCare, 10 mins and still no response. C'mon guys.. updates should elimimate the bugs, not adding new one!"
Gis YM,"Been using this application so many years and for now very Disappointed with the services of the CS. Already do transaction and paid the things but the there's no invoice sent to me. I'm asking to the tokopedia care about this. And the CFS asking me back about the invoice number. If i have the invoice then i will never chat you guy. So bad experince with this online apps. Will never use this apps anymore, better i give some statement in Media Konsumen instead of asking their CS."
The Great Destroyer,"So after the latest update Tokopedia, the app, has become so unresponsive and laggy ‚Äî something I never really had an issue before. Simply scrolling through items I'm looking for has now become such a pain in the ar5e as it keeps freezing every two minutes or so. Guess Tokopedia's trying to play catch up with the ""orange"" app a.k.a. its sibling? Fix the problem ASAP and I might change the rating!"
Hermansyah Emir Faisal,"The shipping forwader has many delay issues during fasting ferstival. Unfortunately, the app management did not seriously resolve this issue. My order arrived more than 4 days even though they promised my packet would arrive at a maximum of 4 days Update : I have just uninstalled and deleted this marketplace after many serious delivery issues, I hope there is another marketplace with good services and price more comprehensive"
Kiddos Branded Outlet,"Tokped used to be my favorite marketplace because its simplicity and convinience but not anymore.. certain payment method are blocked without solid reason along with the promo, I cant entitle a single promo because of this.. erasing items in cart become so stressful.. and so many other reasons.. I prefer orange marketplace nowadays, only shop because some stores only sell in tokped.. otherwise its big NO NO.. so disappointed"
A Google user,"Very bad customer support. I buy an item and use virtual account as payment method. The bank has confirm my fund has been transfered sucessfully, but payment status still ""Waiting Payment"". I upload all prof-of-payment like images and even video. And the CS simply says that I have to wait for 3 f*kin* days. This will be the last time I shop from tokopedia."
A Google user,"Beware before transaction with tokopedia.. this e-commerce is so tricky, would be better if u screen shoot every steps when u'll use the voucher for transaction.. they offer us so many lure cashback voucher, but at the end, the cashback doesn't match with the specified voucher, hell yeah it's a trap.. and when I complained it, I got tricky answer from cust srvc.. bad first shopping experience ever!! It should be zero star for tokopedia if there's zero option.."
Defandry Gunawan,After finally finding a way to submit technical tickets (seriously you need to review here first to get the link). The only explanation i got is the inabillity to use gopaylater when you already setup gopaylater cicil. But your promos could only use gopaylater?!! Well basically nothing good came from the ticket. Leaving this here so others with the same problem could skip the useless chat with the technical customer service (I need to submit so many proof of my account just to get that answer)
Bian Rachman SH,"Shipping speed service of tokopedia like 3 step behind more slower than other marketplace now. With having minimum purchase also to get free shipping making more easily to moving and choosing another app. The cashback isn't special value or offers anymore. Hard to support local marketplace with pride. Should to put and mention with respect, sh*pee development and service is the best right now. Learn from them and kick back as a rock!!!"
A Google user,"worst customer service ever. they only have ONE method of complaints/message: a chat box on their application. took quite a long time to respond, and barely useful. never really helped any problems that you have with your item/seller, they basically only repeat and/or summarize what the seller and buyer talked about with one another."
Tushita JuyalBahuguna,I have been using this app for quite a few years. It is a user friendly app as it is easy to use. I am deducting 2 stars for the poor return policy. The same shop for clothing and shoes allow return on other apps but not on tokopedia. And even if we file complain then also it depends on seller to accept or reject it. As a buyer I feel less protected on tokopedia w.r.t to returns of goods. The app otherwise is good and has made shopping easy and instant.
Meyer R. K.,"Bad system, i downloaded the app and i was supposed to get new user rewards. But when i tried to get the reward the transaction got cancelled, it was cancelled because my address was the same with someone else. I don't understand why that would even be possible, but please fix this, also give me my rewards."
jenny Maria,"By default all the stuff in the basket is always selected and checklist. Then I'm starting to choose what I want to buy. But every time I re-review and goes back to basket, all of my things including different store is back to selected again!!! All I ask is. Could you please shutdown the auto select in the basket?!"
A Google user,"This is my only trusted shopping app that i used almost everyday. Others don't stand a chance because in this app, almost every product have a review atleast one. And when i search the product in their competitor example shopee. There is not a single review on them. I find it less harder to find product here. I really like it and please stop asking for review. 9/10 Stars"
Caesario Natanael Putra Rasdhian,"Such a great apps to buy anything just from smartphone! This apps also have a lot of discount! But i just wondering, it'll be great if Tokopedia have a feature that could scan a product from a photo/video then could give us a product that we want! Hope Tokopedia could realize it. Thank you!"
Krishna Gandhi,"It is very difficult to shop in Tokopedia, while choosing a category such as digital takes into lots of items and no sorting or filter is provided. I checked the IOS version is showing filter and sorting options when accessing categories.why is Tokopedia making android version less interesting to shop.strange while other online shops are getting better."
William,"I purchase some product from bodyshop. They said the package already received by someone name ""neni"" which i dont recognize. The receiver should be ""Takroni"" and its already 3 months and no response. I've tried to use tokopedia care but the transaction wont show up and i cant choose it. I have the chat and order proof tho. But i already use other app that better to order the product. I hope tokopedia can improve"
Dimas Reza,"i scroll up my FEED and click down certain post. As soon as i click back, it automatically goes back to the top screen again. Not to the latest post i've seen. It is plain ridiculous feature update. I love the manual FEED update on the previous version."
Disney Cheeky,"it was good before,using app to shop and review is so much easier.then the app keep updating,then its started happen.can no longer review or send video unboxing through app.C'mon tokped.. we need app that simple and efficient..its becoming nightmare now on Tokped. contacted CS they recommended to download the dropbox to upload foto n video.also asking me to upload it on youtube to be solve.. this is NOT HELPING !"
Pratheesh Nair,"Received faulty product (External hard drive 2TB, make Seagate). Atlast I received an amount of Rp 789,000. But the to and fro courier charges and the insurance amount Rp 113,500 is not received. I think, I lost that much amount. There no way to communicate to Tokopedia. Very very poor service from Tokopedia. Highly disappointed !!! So buyers, please think before you buy something from tokopedia. If you receive a faulty product, the courier and insurance charges may not be reimbursed. Beware!!!"
Agha,Bebas ongkir promo is tied to the worst courier humankind can imagine. Anteraja can take entire day just to take the package from an agent to their station in the same city. Would really like if I can always choose sicepat for the promo. It's such waste that a great online shopping experience is ruined by its own promo and business partner. Tambahan: Sekarang ada logistik sendiri GTL malah gak beres. Lemot bukan main. Udh gitu pengiriman kedua barang gw ilang.
Arsella Selphia (Autumn),"I just got the worst experience with it, the shop not closing down the product even though out of stock. The refund went to tokopedia and hard to claim and the priority of use only after depleting the go pay I used it for a long time- I hate it now. I spend a lot just trying get my money out of the system"
A Google user,"Very Bad experience with purchasing products from one of the merchant. Item received was not as shown in picture and title of the product. An entirely diffrent type. After asking for solution from customer care, they offer refund with item returned to seller. The seller ask for the refunded item to be sent to Maluku, meanwhile seller location is at Kebayoran baru Jakarta, thus I had to send the item to Maluku which cost almost 20% of the item value, hence only approx 80% refunded effectively."
A Google user,"Pros: All in one app, easy to use, every transaction is secure, fast respond. Cons: The coupon is not as much as other competitior give to the buyer. But overall, i love tokopedia."
Agung M,"What's up with the new update? Sort and filters are no longer available when I searched through categories. Filters only available when I used the search bar. Also you tinker with the ui too often, it takes time for people to adjust with a new layout, it's totally unnecessary to change things up every couple of months."
Xenos,"Used to be great with discount vouchers, now they hold little value. The app becomes really annoying by directing users to whatever page they want to promote everytime it is opened. To top it off, now sellers can abuse consumers by sending promo via chat. Lastly, customer support is pretty much non existent with a representative is impossible to be reached."
Ivo Petrov,"This was one of my favorite, but since a few months ago, something happened and I needed to reinstall application. Despite my all trials, update software, etc. I can't download or install this app. Today was my last trial and I'll not do it anymore until change my phone."
Knee Lew,"What I dislike is, too frequent UI updates, and sometimes, 2FA via notification told me that the token isn't valid anymore. While it's good to update UI once in a while, updating it too often will result the users having to learn the new layout, and this often upsets the users. And speaking of 2FA, I have to use the traditional SMS notifications since the in-app approval often tells me that the link is not valid anymore, though I just recently requested it."
Dmitrii,"worst experience. I had to order a speaker with a mic. I picked a product, applied the promo code for the 1st purchase and paid in cash in Alfamart. my order was rejected due to some rule number 9, as if I were violating something, but I did not violate anything! As a result, the money returned inside the application, and since I am a foreigner, I can‚Äôt withdraw it back. support responds with the same messages and does not help at all. just wasted a few hours of my life and nerves!"
A Google user,The app crash on my phone while doing transaction and browsing. This can be very annoying because most of the promotions are in handphone usages. I have updated the most recent updates and I have no idea what is not compatible. I hope this can be improved in the future.
A Google user,"Tokopedia helps me to buy anything from anywhere in Indonesia. BUT, the there is NO clear help when I experienced trouble in my transaction. NO NUMBER PROVIDED for customer care. No clear schedule about customer care. I don't know where to ask when there's trouble in my transaction. Really disappointing for a huge e-commerce. :(((((((("
A Google user,The feature that automaticlally move the item from the cart to the wishlist when it is full really bothering. Before it wasn't like that and it suddenly changing without any notice. Is there any option to prevent that situation? Thanks.
Aulia,"I notice that this app probably the fastest online shop app because the others are slow responding and often force close cause too heavy. I hope tokopedia keep being this light. Don't add some heavy stuff on apps please. Also it might be the reason why the app so light and fast, but please if we have to download some other parts, show us the progress so at least we know whether it takes a long time or not."
wahyudi sukatan,"I hate the UI so much, it's messed up and slowing apps down. Sometime it crashed while I'm in middle of scrolling because took so much memory of the phone. Even for the lastest update version doesn't helps too much."
Asteria Agusti Rani,"Most of the times it's loaded too slow, I had to refresh my network connection to actually get to the images or specific menu. IMO the menu placement is not too convenient/user friendly - there are space of improvement to make it simpler and easier to use."
Slop,One of the most convenient Indonesian market platforms. Only problem with it is how pro-seller it is. Excessive leeway for sellers like only allowing sellers to respond to reviews once and permitting upwards of 3 days to ACCEPT the order and another few days to have the courier fetch the product need to be fixed.
A Google user,"I really love Tokopedia, but most of the coupon can only be used on the Android App, and can't be used on the Web App. Very annoying for me since i do most of my work in Computer and rarely use my Phone because it's slower. Until you change the coupon terms, I'm afraid i will keep the 1 star rating."
Rere,"Perhaps you guys should stop paying kpop artists and started to work on your customer service and your t&c. I can't proceed some transaction and features because ""my account has collide with Tokopedia's t&c"", it's been months, and I didn't even use this app that often, and I've tried to contact the customer service but they keep made me waiting for unrelated answer. This apps sucks and those kpop artists as BA wouldn't help that much"
A Google user,"You gotta be kidding me Tokopedia. Whenever I open this app, it just keeps crashing. This always occurs after 10-20 seconds after I open the app. Tokopedia, please fix this problem!. I really don't like using the web version. I will add 5 stars if you fix the problem. Edit: It's fixed now."
A Google user,"usually this app was helpful,but since it updated to 3.41, I can't even do the payment needed whenever I want to buy something (whenever I pushed ""pay"" button, when usually we got some choices for doing the payment, it left me with a blank screen only with ""payment"" written on top of it). Plz correct this problem ASAP, and I'll give better rating for u."
Azrin,It keeps lagging every time I opened up the app.. it tooks a minute to move from a page to anothe page. It's really frustrating. I want to uninstall it but still have an unfinished transaction. I would never use this app again. Other platform is better.
A Google user,"It's a very good app. Tokopedia is very helpful for your shopping purposes. For me, I could compare the best product with the best price at once. However, recently the app always send me too many advertisement news to my inbox. It's so annoying."
Jennifer Pratama,"This app is actually useful, but i feel disappointed because i've been using this app for so long, but couldnt use any voucher or promo cause it says my account is not verified. But then i try download and use a new device, the voucher seems fine to use. I've tried to contact the tokped care but because its an system so my problem coundnt be fixed."
Darla Song,"Last 3 updates was horrible. I cannot connected to my payment page. I have no problem using the application before, but now I cannot pay my transaction using credit card payment. I tried contacted Tokopedia care for several times, but they didn't gave me any proper solution. I've tried everything, from reinstall the apps and using web version, but it didn't worked out."
A Google user,"Application is so heavy that every time I open it, it takes long time to load all those pictures, even though my wifi connection and my snapdragon 855 have no problem at all. Sometimes, the app goes crash then end up with black screen, and I had to kill it, and reopen it."
Taufiq Purna Nugraha,My favorite shopping app but now out of nowhere theres some kind of podcast popping up and streaming sound without my concent and there's no opt out. Its really annoying even when the phone is on vibrate mode the streaming still playing in the background and disturbing during worktime
Fahdly Saputra,"it is hard for me to admit that they're doing a great job here. A few tweaks will be needed to enhance UX such as üç™ for filter reuse and backward compatibility issue, other than that every other aspect is acceptable. Kudos for tokped team."
Jane A.,"Good apps as described, but the notifications are really spamming my bars. It appeared again literally 1-2 minutes after I deleted the previous notification. That's why I can't see important notification like when I reserved online bike service for instant delivery. Also, when I tapped an item in my wishlist, they put me back to the very start. It also happened when I unheart an item. It's better to not reload so suddenly and let users reload when they want to."
A Google user,"Not a fan of the interface, I find it confusing to navigate. Additionally, their customer service, especially with regards to complaints, is appalling. I think I'll stick to other online shopping apps from now on. Uninstalled."
Ragakasih Theofilus,"At first this app was the best marketplace for shopping, good deals price was good and competitive. Later they have kind of vip membership thet offers recomended shipment but the shipment was not verry punctual and if they already way past the last limit day sent. The app self change the deadline to new date which is not so good experience."
A Google user,"A great market place! I have never found issues with their seller partner. Almost all the stuff I bought arrive within 3 hours. need some improvements in the menu though, i would like to see my most frequently purchases in a glance for repeat orders. And wish to edit the categories to suit my needs. Link in the chat apps bring me to external browser and not to the page within the apps, this inconvenience is preventing me to give full stars."
Atikah Bararah,"My go to app for almost all my shopping need. Easy to use, fast loading, and simple transactions, no need to claim anything to get free shipping. Complain also handled responsively. Keep up the good work! One point though, if you could add category/folder feature into wishlist, that would be great."
A Google user,"Hi Toped, i can't open my Toped apps properly since the last 5days.. It keeps saying if there was an error and ask me to reload, but when i tried to reload, still nothing changes.. Please help, i can only access toped via my pc,and i think it's kinda annoying.. What's the point of having an apps if it can't be accessed? üò™"
A Google user,"Update at your own risk. So, I was a frequent user of this fraction yet useful capability to sort things by its sales performance. But then, they decide to remove the feature, out of the blue. Why they let this slip through their finger? What about the golden rule of ""never repair something that isn't broken""? I know you guys might or might not read this. But the ""sort by sales performance"" is something they shouldn't remove. Bring it back to increase the rating."
A Google user,"I tried to login from my browser, forced to fill OTP pass via sms, didn't receive any sms inbox, resend the sms, have to wait 1 hour, trying to find the feedback form through webapp but redirected to login page haha. trying to disable the OTP but can't find the configuration on the app. please add proper 2fa feature!. and the floating egg with a kpop character is annoying, I just want to browse and buy some stuff, I don't need a silly egg"
Eileen,"My first option for e commerce. Some things can be improved like, how much is minimum purchased for free shipping should be enclosed. And recently I encountered a problem. Free shipping not apply in computer, but it applies in phone. It all using same account, that's why make me confuse. Overall price and variety are not better than s*****. Use toped because better cashback and free shipping programme."
Maylan St John,"I have many good experiences using this app over many years. Sometimes, it's about choosing the sellers. I've been buying things cash and credits, and all good. I bought the cheapest things to the more than fifty million rupiah items, and all are good experience. Yes, I also experience one seller who didn't respond much to my complaint, but I think that is a seller problem. Thank you Tokopedia."
Yafi' Ahmad Ashshidqi,"One of the best marketplaces I've ever used. Because the experience is very pleasant, the appearance is neat/nice, easy to access quickly, the arrangement of space/place is very balanced.I can even say that the shopping application is the easiest to use even for ordinary people, because there is education for buyers or sellers in the form of instructions/articles."
Menik Sulastri,"I don't know exactly what's wrong but whenever I open the app it always take some times to load and my phone run slower and even slower when I get into customer's reviews. I couldn't see the picture or video thumbnail as usual, I have to click one of those review and -again- it takes a while to see the full review.. the worst thing is everytime I stop the app my phone suddenly blank, all the apps icon I have in my phone, they're all gone.. and after a minute or two they'd comeback"
Izzuddin Ahsanujunda,"Very disappointed that insurance protection opt-in by default for some items, and it is really easy to miss on the checkout page because of all other options cluttered in a single page. I am never checking out with tokopedia again until this is changed."
Okky Ramadanti,"I cant add new address anymore. Been try several times with several case but after pressing Save, theres nothing happen, no new address appear. How can i purchase items if i cant add new address?! What can I do is edit my existing address to update my new one, its so anoyying. Also your ads algorithm on product listing is reducing my shopping experience, because it keeps showing same products over and over."
A Google user,"As of 21 July 2020: spam promos from the chat section still exists (blocking duration increaee from 1 month to 6 months but still have to block each account manually because there is no setting to stop receiving this spam). Oh and this is new, you also will randomly start to hear their streaming service (tokopedia play) playing in the background, even though you are not currently inside the app. This app just keep getting more annoying to use."
El Muncilo,"New version which i rembember from December 2020 was really dissapointing, no sort/filter button found computer component, its only showing if you use manual search with keyword. I am an active reseller who always looking for newly posted ad from computer component category, i spent beetween 20-30 million rupiah every month with tokopedia, and i oftenly use it with mobile application. But now with this new version it is impossible for me to search for my stuff again. Very very dissapointing."
levend mama,"The worst marketplace ... They closed my shop with unclear reasons, only on one-sided criteria and they couldn't say the reasons honestly. Please note, that my store has many regular subscriptions from all cities in Indonesia, and this worst marketplace has taken 1% of the store turnover, but they keep closing it ... The cashback voucher issue they provide, it is the customer's right and should not be linked with shop. For the latter, I WILL NEVER recommend you to install this worst marketplace"
Pangky Kurniawan,"( Edit ) 1 üåü because tokopedia always on sellers side. Tokped/tokopedia, has rule, if 2x48 hr, the seller don't input tracking number, the transaction is cancelled. So the seller has idea to input FAKE TRACKING NUMBER, that will give THE SELLER 5 MORE DAYS to input the right one. And TOKPED ACKNOWLEDGE this behavior. If cannot fullfil the order, just cancel and give back the money. Once, I ordered snacks, and it took almost 3 weeks to arrived. From the same city BYEBYETOKPED."
Jay Haura' Dary,"I dunno how to describe this. But the interface of app is error frequently. Usually happen if im open the review / description of the goods. It's laggy and freezing (i can't moving / scrolling) pls fix it. It happen when im updating new OS (Android 9 MIUI 11). This apps is good that have very much electronic quality product. But if this happen buggy happen, i cant do anything."
Trisha Barrychella,"I've been using tokopedia since early stages, love this as other users mainly because of easy user interface and allow user to use cashback voucher & free shipping voucher at the same time.. not just that but it crashed occasionally too while wanting to checkout items or when looking at some reviews photos.. I never thought that I will choose other ecommerce app but these days have been unpleasant experience + after the update I'm not sure maybe i should really go switch to the other app.."
Harry Muurling,"Because the old perfect working menu is back I give 5 stars. Advice for the wishlist, it would be perfect if you could make for yourselve in the wishlist categories, example electronics and the all your electronics save in one menu, it saves time for me, now I have to look throughout the whole wish list because 50 % of my shopping is already through tokopedia."
Anita Aitken,"I had been using tokopedia for sometime, until oneday the app asked to install the update. When I click the update the app couldn't update and can't open. So I uninstall it, so I can reinstall again. But now it can't install at all. It's been really frustrating, i still have points and money in it. This is a scam!"
A Google user,"Too much notification and I can't seem to disable the ads notification permanently. I did everything to disable the ""not important"" notification but still got notification of some useless and irrelevant stuff after sometime. I went as far as disabling whole app notification from the system. But doing so I can't be notified if someone buys my stuff or if the stuff i bought are being sent etc."
Bimo Adityarahman,"You should always take extra caution when choosing a trusted seller and expedition. My last problematic transaction causes me a loss of 13mill rp, which hasn't been reimbursed by tokopedia since more than a month ago. If your transaction is problematic and is handled by tokopedia care, be ready for it not solved anytime soon with unhelpful and uninformative customer service. Just assume your money is lost. (Edit: the money's been refunded after 2 months. Thanks tokped for your great services)"
Yumir Syamsyah,"The bug is need to be fixed. I cannot send a photo from my camera to Seller in chatbox, it cannot be send eventhough i tried to close the app or reinstall it and the error notification pop-up every time I choose the re-upload option. Type: Samsung S20+"
dinda setiawan,"I don't know if it's a bug or not, but the quantity of my items in my cart gets reset to 1 everytime I re-enter my cart. It's reeeeaaaally inconvenient. I end up only receiving 1 out of each items I intend to order, while choosing a bulk-item delivery option. Hope this bug gets fixed soon! All else, quite a nice app."
A Google user,after your newest update version and brand new UI why i can not find dropshipper feature? is it missing or hidden? and why it's so hard to add new recipient address? it is constantly close. many bugs in your updated versions. how is your QC and UAT team doing? fix it and i will give you 5 stars back.
Michelle Lin,"Have always love shopping from tokopedia, even move all together from orange shop, but recently is very upset with limitation of wish list allowed to be added, and also very unhappy with the limit of items allowed to be added in cart. I have no such problems with orange shop at all. And today discovered that my free delivery voucher disappeared by itself. And can't use free delivery with other promotion anymore. Not happy at all with it, tokopedia, really. Consider to go back to the orange now"
Erlangga Pradipta,"I've used tokopedia for years. I decided to not use it anymore if i can help it. Mine an my friend's account are considered to belong to the same person, we can't use the same promo. I've had the promo revoked several times and each time i have to explain again that we're not the same person, until the last time tokopedia care said that they don't need the proof that we're different person. Such arrogance. I've had it."
A Google user,"The best e-commerce I've ever use. All of those feature, smooth application, simple appearance, trusted seller, the paid system, etc. Thank you because my shopping experience never get trouble. Please be kind to increase your apllication for better experience :)"
Gallen Zukhrufrahman Giansya,"It's so heavy for 3GB RAM device's, I keep crashing every 30 minutes. Even when I have no any apps running in the background, and it's just keep crashing. And the latest updates make it much more worser than the previous update."
Indonesia Pintar,"Helpful, but so many updates in short time it become a hassle, so fustrating. Even I can't put an item to the basket just bcoz it needs an update again, and again. Also if you want your money back becoz of the seller's fault, tokopedia put your money in user's point reward so you can't help getting your money back to your bank account, but to spend it again in tokopedia. You can't stole ppl money like that, yo."
Aghiano,"I change my review. It's already fixed, but i still don't know what was happening. I still love using tokopedia tho, keep up the improvement! ** I have updated the app then i can't even enter to the review section. It says that i have to try again or leave it a moment and try again later. But i have waited for couple days and still doesn't work."
A Google user,"Actually Tokopedia is the most comfortable app to shop as it offers plenty of cashback and wide choices of products. However: the app runs very slow (on Android OS 7), often stuck in payment page and photo upload page. I have to close the app and reopen it. Additional suggestion: allow wishlist to be categorized/searched by category, just like if we want to search product. Would be useful for people with a wide range of wishlist (apparels, electronics, foods)."
Angel,I kept getting random multiples chat in my notifications which I never sent before. When i tried to open it it was an error in server. It keep getting in and disturbed me. I think it was another person conversations but i don't know how it came to my notifications. Please fix it immediately.
F S,"Really want to give no star. Been using the app for years. I did notice the deals and discounts kept diminishing over the years. Today was the end of straw. ""Bebas ongkir"" now meant ""we'll cut 5rb off your shipping fee."" Even shipping WITHIN Jakarta itself cost at least 10rb. Feels much like false advertisement. Food for thought: maybe rethink about the term. Also, whenever I used the web to make orders, the so called ""bebas ongkir"" option was never available. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
A Google user,"The app is good for guide people who want to get something quick and easy, with the different postal services it can slow you to get you product really quickly and the app also great for its wide rang of things you can buy which is great because sometimes you can't buy them in store."
A Google user,"By far the best online market for me, But the UI and UX need a huge improvement, too cluttered, at first load user must face with a barrage of small icons and unwanted popups, even when i dismissed one popups, 4 others pops right in my screen. Annoying. At some point even some crucial buttons failed to load because of all the tiny animations in 1 screen. Maybe have the option to personalize every user home screen. Just show them what they wanna see. Everything from dailys to specialize items."
yanda pr,"15 July 2020.. Tonight i just updated the application. I search my product on app as usual. My product search listing looks fine, But it looks some menu missing on the top side. I can't do filtering my product list anymore. When i open the toped app, then switched to another apps, then swtiched back to toped apps, the apps won't respond any command, then appear notification that ""no internet acess"" eventhough my wifi or cellular data works fine. Please, fix this update app bug."
Robby Andi,"After update, i cant check on transaction detail, always told me to try again, altough i hv good internet connection here, other than that is ok. Update: againn.. After updating, product image ddnt shown, only shown when on list, but when product on list was clicked, the product image is blank,..."
prihatin karmeni,"Something can't be described with words, it can be understood easily with picture. I've tried many times, you lead to other things. So, please add picture search... I know, it's much more difficult & costly to make... But hey, you want to be the number 1, aren't you?"
Ranny Soeharsono,"Still the best app in Indonesian e-commerce. However, I notice it has been some lag lately after flash sale and video ads are on. The feeds are mostly in error these days. It needs some improvement. Hope your IT team can handle it."
A Google user,The developer is lacking of monitoring the application features. Select button for 'location' in the filter feature is not working for more than 3 days and nobody is doing anything about it. Embarassing and dissapointing!
Atul Kabra,"Pro: Clear & easy navigations. stable app. Wide array of selections and reliable sellers. Con: Could not find english language support in mobile app, which might make people to switch to website to be able to use 'translate to english' option."
Heru Hariyanto,My Fav Online Shop so far. Credible and Easy Payment Method. keep up a good job Tokopedia But it' s getting more difficult to enter the apps. Not quite sure if it's due to many bugs in the system or IT issue or whatever. But something definetely needs to be fixed.
Wachid Susilo,"EDIT: Solved by now. Original: There is a bug in transaction list. The notification count is there, but the actual items are empty. Why did you release a version with a bug in it? There is no beta tester in your company? I'll add 2 more stars if you solve this issue."
adhitya aji,"New update ruins the feeds page UX, i have to side scroll every item i wanted to see, and the side scrolling function feels lagging and unresponsive, and also why every products in feeds have larger picture size but hiding the item's price (or atleast you need to tap the picture) which previously just visible under the product picture, please if it's not broken don't fix it."
A Google user,"Too much notification and I can't seem to disable the ads notification permanently. I did everything to disable the ""not important"" notification but still got notification of some useless and irrelevant stuff after sometime. I went as far as disabling whole app notification from the system. But doing so I can't be notified if someone buys my stuff or if the stuff i bought are being sent etc."
Adri Dharma Rolos,"Good app at previous weeks. At last 4 days back I should to stress to find many issues of your app. Failed to load, keep try, lost of connection, processing of payment (home credit) difficult to process by clicking several time of ""AJUKAN"". once its successful the follow the registration then finally should to clik ""Kirim"" as this was a final process but it was back again has to click ""Kirim"" again & again more than 20 times. Many others issues but its to much to displaying here. So bad!!!"
Dokferr,"Love this app. The layout / UI is clean, not cluttered. Everything is organized pretty well. My main complaint is since the latest update, I can only see gopay points, no more ovo which is annoying. The other one is no dark mode."
A Google user,"Tokopedia is definitely NOT my favorite shopping App. I tried many times to use the coupon/discount to shop, but it doesn't work. It also says if I confirm that my product has arrived, I will get a cashback. But I did NOT get any cashback. The cashback promos are also super STINGY. and my Tokped app in my phone gets truly BAD connection ALL the time. Tokped is BAD & NOT reliable at all."
A Google user,"Very easy to use. Refund from cancelled transaction will go straight into our Toped account, we don't need to make Toped cash or whatever it is, like other app. Any problems occured would be solved quickly and accurately by Toped team. I've been shopping here for years, and always happy. üëç"
Azfa,"ive had enjoyable experience with tokopedia. im very impressed with the UI, its tidy and neat yet still looks very appealing. it is also easy to use and isnt laggy. however i would like english language to be available on the app. congrats tokped, im a loyal customer now üòÉ"
Livia Novitarani,"Disappointing, you can't combine voucher for shipment and cashback anymore. This is so annoying. While on the orange marketplace or other marketplaces you can combine vouchers. Won't purchase anything from tokopedia starting this November. And also, your partnership with lion parcel for free shipment is annoying. They don't wait for me to receive the goods, they just shouted once and throw the package rigth in front of me while I open the door."
hardi gunadi,"Bad Priority Tokopedia Care. As a priority, I don't feel prioritize by Jane (Priority Tokopedia Care staff). As a buyer, I paid the transaction first. As long as the seller hasn't send the item, it is buyer right to cancel the transaction. Why customer care hold the buyer money? It is a business stuff. If you late to send to customer, you lose your customer trust. It is about trust not just the money."
mete Mete,"Tokopedia , I am so disappointed. You do not punish the bad vendors. They supply broken goods, and we have to pay for courier cost even we return. And they still keep on selling through other names. Most of the time return of faulty goods doesn't happen , it times out. And you also list some companies on top list, as if they sold many. But somehow they actually sold even let's say 100 pcs. You make them look like they sold 1000 pcs. So many fake goods in your database. You do nothing about it"
Bryan Nawanjaya,"The first and only online-store app I ever use. Very addicting! New deals everyday! Almost all features I need are available. Many payment methods provided. But the courier choices are now a bit strictly limited, I think üëå"
Victor Rahman,"I no longer recommend this app for anyone, delivery courier recommendations is a bad idea it's like online shopping from late 2000s in terms of time, also there's no much difference between plus and non plus user little cashback and sometimes still charged for shipping ugh, thankfully I moved on from this app."
A Google user,"Update to ver 3.16 because can't retrieve information on Account tab. But, in this 3.16, app name changed to Tokopedia Lite. Account tab can be accessed but how come I can not upload picture of item wanted to sell? The were only some square that intended to touch for browsing picture file that needed to be upload but it seemed that interface didn't react"
A Google user,"The apps is isruptive to browser tokopedia link. Useless promotion push adds. Only use it to claim dicount coupon, then uninstall. Purchasing using OVO, the transaction is not shown on tokopedis system. OVO transaction number appear but no Tokopedia transaction number at all, the items stays in cart. Its hard to complain without Tokopedia transaction number. The apps is problematic, transaction bug is very dangerous. Dont use this app."
Gavin Mark Starkey,Great desktop site because it has an english option. App should have an English language option. Search criteria should be narrowed done. When you search for a product so many unnecessary items also come up. Sellers should only put appropriate keywords not random click bait to draw views to their sites. Also not happy with unsolicited messages in my inbox.
Kevin Avery,"'Money back guarentee' although is credit note. For exanple buying a computer, several million rupiah, but seller got it wrong immedietly after payment. 'Actually, out of stock'. Have to accept tokopedia credit voucher just for that mistake. Very bad..... Customer service staff hard to reach and do not help at all. So 3 stars out of 5 for app."
Purple Ice Bear,"Haven't used this app for months and decided to use it again. I thought there was improvements, but not at all. Tried to buy something, but when I wanted to change payment methods, it stucked. Looked like you forced me to pay with BCA, cuz that was the default payment."
Peter Tahirzada,Hi. The new UI is very overwhelming and hard to finding the options. The fonts & buttons are smaller and it requires a very sharp eye to find. The previous design was way very better. Please make it better!
A Google user,"My favorite marketplace. Can order easily. Automatic confirmation. Many choice of payment. I always go for KlikBca though. It is just make the whole transaction time-efficient. Also I often got vouchercodes. Not much but still useful. Ah, i am also happy to know we can donate via this marketplace. Oh i just remember, it is now possible to top up e-money. Damn. I love Tokopedia. I hope Tokopedia can bring more official brands to sell their products on its platform."
dita indah oktaviani,"Little bit confusing app for using. I can't find some search from my not right keywords, eventhough only punctuation or less one word. And this app needs update continously, which is it needs more space memory. Maybe Tokopedia will improve my not good experiences. Thx"
satriya pambudi,"I have been usig tokopedia for years now. Every year im pretty satisfied with the updates. But now it seems to have downgraded a bit. I used to like the notifications page where you can see the status of your order with very communicative icons (konfirmasi, proses, sedang dikirim, paket sampai) but one day i was surprised to see those icons gone instead now im only seeing 4 tabs of a list of notifications which is pretty inconvenient when you are ordering multiple things at once."
Abe Herman,"The app itself does work just fine, although once you start browsing too deep you'll start to notice the app being not too responsive. What I find not very pleasing was the lack of ability to erase my browsing history. Everytime I stumble upon an odd item and went to look at it, anything related to that item will continue to show as I browse - Very annoying, don't like it, hate to see them. Wish they added the feature to manage and erase your browsing history."
Dessy Siahantera,"This is very disappointing, because I'd love to shop with tokped, but everytime there is a flash sale or ongoing event like tokopediaxnyam, i can not open at all, it's like loading and then refresh to home page all over again, I'd like to buy but it seems i cannot buy anything at all. Please advise how to work this matter."
Grey,Have been using tokopedia for 5 years. It's okay until any problem occur. If so you will wait a solution for months. I made an order on July 25. Still spending my time complaining. So disappointed. There are alternatives working faster and much better. Bye tokopedia.
Nik Kusuma,I paid more than 1500AUD on 3 separate purchases but the sellers didn't have the item in stock and didn't advertise as no stock and i didn't get refunded. I contacted tokopedia customer care after more than 14 work days and they insisted they already gave me refund and blamed on my credit card company after i showed them no refund on my statement. I had to call my credit card's customer care to help getting my money back. Just be careful. Tokopedia will try and steal your money whenever they can
Ericca Fitri,"I have been experiencing ""Koneksi terputus"" problem for about 2 times in 2 months. I don't know what to do, i cannot do anything inside the app. I have already cleared cache, reinstalled, but same thing still happen. All I can do is only sit back and wait for couple days, and it will be fixed by itself. And fyi, my internet connection is fine. I have tried by using wifi and cellphone internet package. This is annoying, please fix this!!"
Sir. Raids,"1st no search by image in 2022-almst 2023, 2nd when you use the ""similar products to this"" button 80% of the time it will just show ""there is no product similar to this"" then i see the exact similar products with sometimes the exact products picture with various prices meaning there is ""similar products to this"". i want to love this app but itself just bring so many bad thing and make me comeback to the competitor app, 3rd how can you let seller to make HUNDREDS of listing for the same product"
Steven Adi Wiguna,"This review contains: 1. Scam 2. Wasted time (no compensation) I already paid since sunday night. The seller said it was ready stock, so I ordered it right away. But then till tuesday, there's no progress to my item (not yet delivered). I asked the seller, how's my item? They said, today we updated the ""resi"". But my item status wasnt progressing at all and now my order is canceled ny system. WORST THING THEN: CAN'T EVEN WRITE A REVIEW FOR THE SCAMMER CAUSE I NEVER BUY AN ITEM FROM THEM PLS FIX"
A Google user,"Recent update really messed up the overall accessibility of the application,Trading Intuitive UI to a more ""cleaner"" version,searching for something has become a chore,most importantly : where is the ""most purchased"" sorting function that was found in the general searching option couples of updates back?"
Fukji,The new ui update is annoying as they put the cart icon on the top of the screen making it hard to use one handed while the wishlist icon is put where the cart was instead. I liked the ui before where wishlist is part of the cart. Hope you can fix this to make the one handed experience better unlike the orange marketplace
Prasz WONGSOWIJOYO,"The app is OK... But the way they operate the online business, is going bad to worse day by day... If you bought something from their seller and there was something happened to your order(s)... They're made it complicated to redeem your money (more than weeks for getting your money back) first 5 (five) working days for investigation, then if it really happened, then it takes 3 (three) day to pay you back and it hadn't entered you account, it still need days to be transfered to your account..."
A Google user,"there is an item that is ready stock yet the item cannot be added into the cart, saying that the item is sold out. After reaching the seller, the seller insists that the stock is ready and can be ordered. however, after I clearing my cart and try to reorder the item, the system keeps saying that the item is not ready. please fix this, this can be a bug in the system. thanks a lot :)"
Dominicko Satrya,"Could you PLEASE, give an indicator whether a review video is being buffered or not? Like a loading indicator, changes of the button.. None, like i think it was my connection, i reset my connection like 3 times just to know that it is the app that is not doing anything üòÖ"
Andy Leo,"Too many dishonest sellers there. Bought a motherboard & it came with leaking capacitors. Requested refund, not only have to pay for shipping but must pay packaging fees. Ordered a spray bottle, the nozzle is missing, same thing happened. Many sellers just send damaged goods to customers & Toped cared for nothing!"
Andreas Febrian,"I love shopping in Tokopedia. However, some logic in the application does not make sense. I'll give you a list. -- First: Frequently, when I open the apps, the application gives a popup about an event or something. My reaction is, ""Wow! I have installed your mobile application, and you still give me a popup. I mean, it's your mobile application on my phone, being installed; what else do you want?"" It is annoying that I have to do an extra tap when using an application dedicatedly build for shopping in your store. Talk about a bad user experience. -- Second: Another annoying thing is that your application sometimes tries to ""help"" with my shopping list, such as buying a mobile data package. The thing is, I never use that suggestion. If you really want to help, then track which one of those ""forced shopping suggestions"" was actually used by the user and then adjust your application behavior based on that. This will provide a better user experience. -- Third: You always suggested not to communicate with sellers via media aside from your application. This means, chat feature becomes a necessary component in such a business model. Yet, you assumed buyers want to receive marketing information from any of the shops they browsed or peeked. I missed some messages from the sellers because of that. I think you need to make up your mind and redesign the chat logic. Suggestions: Provide an exclusive notification icon for the chat, including the unread message Instead of using chat, create a marketing feed that buyers can tap into voluntarily -- Fourth: The mobile application admin on Google Play always suggests user post their suggestion to tkp.me/supportMainapps. However, that page is to report problems regarding the apps, not to provide suggestions."
A Google user,"Never save your card number in tokopedia. Will automatic transact without OTP verification. And always error when changes verification setting to bank instead of tokopedia. Try some method mobile web browser, pc web browser the result still same. Error! Delete your save card number. Customer service does not helping. No solution, they should be responsive on the feedback. Ask your developer too investigate! instead of asking customer to check! It's not pleased!!!"
Rev Con,"Give me the previous one Once upon a time when I'm still using symbian, Tokopedia has the best searching feature. Now? All I can see is ads. The new interface? Hey why you think why people keep coming back to this platform? Because there's simplicity in it. Why you keep making it more complicated? I feel sorry for your marketing team they've been doing very great job yet your team ruin it with this so called as upgrade"
Heru Saputro,i buy voucher here with credit card then the apps error and close. i cancelled the transaction and it was success. but my cc charged me for the transaction from tokopedia. i've complain it to tokopedia customer service but no solutions. i will tell my friend and suggest to never download this app.. thanks for robbing my money üëç
A Google user,2 Stars because the application is buggy and even when i have network or wi-fi connection it says that something is wrong and asks me to keep retrying. Do some bug-fixes please. not just Update the looks in-app but fix the bugs
maharanie puspadewi,"This app works perfectly, but I have one problem. I cannot give rating for the sellers who cancel my order. I got 2 sellers that cancel my order without any prior notice. It might be appreciated if Tokopedia could make us rate the stores that cannot even give their customer any good communicative-service. I hope that this can give other customers more awareness of the quality of the Store before paying any cents."
A Google user,"This is actually very good online shopping app. Trusted, responsible, and with user friendly feature onlime shopping app. However, I really hate using this app since it promote the Korean Boyband, with their sucks photos everywhere in the app. Please, stop this. It is sucks to see their photo every time I open this app. I am thinking to remove and delete my account and migrate to other online shopping apps, if this Korean faces still pop up all over the app this month."
A Google user,"Personally, my favourite online shopping place as it provides many many kinds of items and tons of promos, discounts,and cashback. It also allows me to discover stuff that I cannot buy so easily/readily physically. Thank you Tokopedia."
Candra Wardhana,"Several times I intend to fix buying product offered, but after I put it on shopping basket, I cannot close the purchase, instead I was continuously offered with other products I may like, distracted my attention and I have difficulty to confirm the purchase. Eventually I move to other online app which offer simpler solution to close the purchase."
Chris N,Not user friendly at all. Frustrating to fully create an account(having the ability to create an account on an email OR a phone number allowing you to accidently create 2 seperate accounts). And it's such a hassle to report a problem. This is a really terrible app made by horrible and terrible developers
A Google user,"There are a lot of bugs. I clearly input the voucher for ""THR"" cashbacks during a purchase but was then told couldn't receive the cashback since I didn't input it. Well clearly I do, since why would I not want to use the voucher and get cashbacks in the first place. Furthermore, I tried chatting with the help center, after sending messages, it displayed an empty box without messages to them. The not caring robot like response from the CS is not helping. Please don't offer promotion if it's fake."
A Google user,"It's alright. It did it's job well enough. Been using it for 2 years but the recent feature really pissed me off; hence this review. The ""influencer"" update is alright before and I don't have to see em all the time, which is nice. It seems that it didn't work tho, at least by Tokopedia standard anyway because now IT SHOWS UP IN MY FEED EVERY 3-4 ENTRIES. It's hard enough before but now it's a shitshow! Can we please for love of god choose whether we want to see influecer's recommendations?"
Darxen XV,"Actually this is a very brilliant application for fast shipping online shop which allows us to purchase anything we would like to possess. But unlike the other online shops, it does not feature English language in its costumization setting that helps to understand more about the details of every product supplied or when selecting the menu option as almost the whole texts are entirely written in Indonesian language."
A Google user,Hands down the best experience you can have in online shopping. ux is is almost flawless ui also simple and effective and the app is working smooth without any problem. And the way you guys handle every single step from purchase till the delivery is simply awesome. Love the tracking reports in purchased items which shows every step of the process after the paymeny is made till you recieve your purchased goods. Keep up the good job.
A Google user,"Greatest UI and UX among the other online marketplaces. I have done many transactions here, easy steps to buy and complaint, good rating system. And last but not least, there's always many good deals and promotions."
Prkash Khatwani,"Your new update is so bad so bad... I just can't describe, it's really moronic. I want to go back to previous version. The problem is you app is forcing us to give review. There is no READ ALL option. Otherwise, the notification is always highlighted. Do something. Many people are very irritated with this. Be considerate."
A Google user,A great apps but bad customer service. Its funny that tokopedia is providing only bot assistant for customer service or by email only. When i believe most of the indonesian still prefer to complaint and explain their problem by phone. Its totally exhausting when u have problem with ur buying and have to wait for email reply from the customer service. I better waiting on the phone queieng line than waiting for email reply.
Indrasari Punjung,"When I delete an item from my wish list, I hope it's just the item I deleted which disappear, not the whole page refreshing so I got to start scrolling from the beginning again. I suggest you to learn the UX from your competitors on this part, they developed it well and made it more convenient for their users."
Mohammad Ridho Hilman,"After updating the app to the newest version, seems the app has internal downloading data that says ""download lagi diproses"". The bad thing about these that almost every action that i do would go to these downloading process, and it stays at that phase. These has no problem with my internet connection bcs my internet is fast. What i disappointed about these is why in the earth you downloading the new update at the playstore but inside the app you still need to download stuffs? Its all pointless."
A Google user,"Lot of transactions successful with this application, with very much discount, and cashback, also very large kind of goods, the only one uncomfortable point is you can not talk directly by phone to their Customer support team when several transaction problem occurs, just by chat, or email. Overall, Good Application, happy buy and sale.."
A Google user,"User experience has been fine so far with normal non-experimental methods of purchasing until I came across a merchant with JNE-only delivery service (written in the product description box). The merchant couldn't process the delivery because I chose another delivery service company offered by the app. I cannot blame the merchant, but from a user experience perspective, the app ideally has to narrow down options presented to the user for the whole process to succeed."
Lukmanul Hakim,"NEW FEATURE UPDATE A useless feature that called Kurir Rekomendasi that literally send your package AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE by changing one logistic company to another TWICE or THREE TIMES, so your package will be delivered to you on the SLOWEST ESTIMATION TIME. Thank you Tokopedia...! It's useless to complain in this app, since there are only bots to complain when you didn't receive your package yet, but the system automatically decided that the package has been sent."
Bharata Satria,"Can you create a lite version for practical shopper like me who open-search-buy-close in less than two minutes? I am considering deleting the app and shop via web. Update 24/2/21 I did delete, but found that web version has no ""free ongkos kirim"" option, so I keep this app for finishing transaction. Last update made this app worse, all about bombarding user with ads and ""info"", even in message box. You made me a wronged but helpless user. You can sound your evil devilish laugh now, you win."
Bahar Arbi,"This app runs very slow, and loading a page would sometimes feel like it takes forever. Opening this service via browser feels so much faster. The app is associated with sapx courier, the worst and laziest courier in indonesia. The packages will come very late or even not come at all with this courier."
A Google user,"Kurirnya tidak pernah pickup. Puh!! what i dont like most is its customer service response. it puts robot to answer my problem. 2. price shown may not the real price as sellers put the lowest price to attracts your attention, but when you click buy, sellers doesnt accept, but seller sends you WA instead. 3. too many ads makes the sort menu on price has no function. 4. Ive experienced scam from toped, 5. when you need help their CS will reply you in 6 hrs. Its one of the worse market place."
A Google user,1. very bad experience with tokopedia. the help button is pretty much useless. 2. i had an experience of returning goods as sender send the wrong goods. the help itself isnt even helpful. Tokopedia knew they send the wrong stuff and the seller acknowledge they send the wrong stuff. before i could even send the goods back tokopedia had already transfer the money to seller. we are force in the mercy of tokopedia which stands at the seller side! the insuranc is useless no point even buying it.
dxdy x,"for the longest time i use this app,, this new update 3.177 just keep on crashing, force close, back to home page all the time. it's been 2 days, can't even message seller because it always force closed. please fix this asap. update: fixed it well in new update 3.177.1 no problem using it for 10+ days. well done teams"
redemptus immanuel,"New policy is getting more and more ridiculous. Can't apply 2 promos simultaneously (ie. Free shipping and cashback promo). Also shipping cost is too expensive compared to other e-commerce. Been using this app for years, never been this disappointed."
Crestle S,"Be warned. New policy from this store allows sellers to offer Paxel shipping. A few days would pass, but suddenly the shipments get cancelled altogether. The store would refund the purchase amount, but somehow either the store, or the shipper, or Tokopedia being complicit, pocketed the shipping AND insurance fees. If you filed a complaint, you get the circular online run abouts, no solution. Overnight shipment turns into weeks of ordeal. Tokopedia insurance is WORTHLESS. It makes claims slower."
A Google user,"great platform for shopping, good item selection. though the costumer service is trash. once you stumble into a problem, it will be long waiting game. CS basically only ask us to wait 1x24 hour,or 2x24 hour till the problem resolve itself,you guys rely on system automation too much. on another e-commerce platform, a problem with payment like mine will be dealt almost instantly. currently three days waiting them to refund my payment."
Uwwuuu (Gondo),"This app is just good, nothing's wrong, everything I need just there and it works just fine. But the thing is, they don't have dark mode (or I can't find it somewhere deep in their complicated settings). Soooo.. Yeah. I can't use this app without burning my eyes since I always have my phone on dark mode, it's kinda hurt when something bright piercing your eyes like eventually. It's a surprise that I don't need, but I'm still kinda shook even thoo it's happening all the time. Soo please guysüòÜ"
Kelly Kirsten Audrey,"I have been using Tokopedia for quite some time because it is indeed trustworthy. However, lately, when using the shipping option (recommended courier), one of the recommended couriers is not at all worthy of recommendation due to its painfully slow delivery. I am no longer comfortable using Tokopedia. In the Jabodetabek area, it takes a week for delivery and still got extended. Even in google maps, the courier company got all 1 star review. C'mon, the courier is not recommended AT ALL."
Eka Darma Hidayati,"I don't have any complaint about the UI /UX for this app, I've been using tokped for years, but recently, tokped has been really stingy with promo and discount. You are the one that offer limited free shipping regarding the membership! Now what? I can't use free shipping along with promo/vouchers?! What's the use of membership anyway! You clearly said user have quota for free shipping! If it's like this what's the difference between free shipping and vouchers!"
Inge Anggraini,"Good apps! I really enjoy to shop here almost for everything. I even can pay my bills and the benefit is i can get cashback from the coupons that this app provide every month. But i have suggestion from my experience, i hope you can provide pick up service for wrong item that the seller send to buyer. Because it happen sometimes & really annoying when the seller send a wrong/ different type of product than i order and i myself should go out just to send it back in exchange for the right product."
Freda Illene,"Now you want us to do verification for ordering any alcohol and stuff and I have no problem about it. The problem is this verification way is a joke. You rejected my verification twice now. The latest one said that my face is incorrect. Excuse me but this is my original face and the lighting in my office is very bright that it annoys me sometime. Contacted the CS but useless. Do something about it, pls. Don't make it harder for us! 1-star rating for now."
"I Wayan Sudharya,S.W.","The system software is complete and customizable, and NOW I suggest Tokopedia care to give a serious assistance in solving the customers' complaint mainly in cases of product changes with the sellers. In the most of TV stations, Tokopedia always advertises that everything the customer buys is free from delivery cost, however, the reality, that is hoax or untrue, because I am a gold member have to pay 3 of 4 delivery cost for goods that I buy. Do not broadcast hoax if you can not do the truth."
Lionie Cantika,Crashed many times whenever searching for product and checking on product detail. Happened just around 2 days ago (after app update?) Previously toped was my favourite compared to orange competitor which is super slow compared to toped. Pls fix this issue.
Nur Alif Ilyasa,"V3.84 app constanly disconected from internet after several minute. It shown no internet page. My internet always connected, but i know it's not really stable. I need to restart the app to continue shopping. Might be socket problem. UPDATE It's been fixed. Thanks!"
Ricky A,"new policy requires limitations of wishlist but did not provide a massive deletion of wishlist (does not provide select all), are you saying we have to delete one by one for thousands of wishlist? for example I filtered it to list all the unavailable items, after the filter, when I want to delete, I have to select 1 by 1, there is no select all. lousy Dev."
Setia Budi Halim,You got more problem when you subscribe to Plus. The more they charge customers with many kinds of fee but the less they care. They send courier to pick from seller after business hour and the system doesn't automatically assign new courier when one cancel pick up. Same day selivery takes literally days. This platform sucks.
Dustin Wolff,"Unresponsive seller, error and laggy customer center, rigid and glorified 'tanya' chatbot which supposed to be ""smart"" but only able to send me some statements regarding very obvious policy. I know what's coming after I cancelled my order, but you refused to understand the bigger picture that your Seller did that forced me to cancel. Tokopedia used to be a great and safe place to shop. Sadly, not anymore.."
Muhammad Salman,"my transactions have been denied for TWO TIMES because of an error in the voucher system. how should i know there's a minimal amount of free ongkir? and the apps keep crashing itself for couple times while doing the verification process, couldn't care less."
A Google user,"EDIT: new update sucks. Favorite ilang semua, ovo statusnya g aktif, paylater statusnya under maintenance, alamat pengiriman ilang. Stupid update ! Good mobile app, very light and responsive. Notification however will overlap between coming from the email and this app itself, so there will be a lot of notif and not very pleasant when you ordering something."
A Google user,"Never having true problem in shopping. But sometimes I find scrolling through product list endlessly and realizing that exactly the same product list is displayed again and again and again. Is that a bug, or a way to keep customers as scrolling-addicts...?"
A Google user,"the feature is fine. i love that i can pay my electricity, internet, and water bill on one app. but the UX is confusing. there's so many things going on in the first view, making me, the user, just confused and annoyed. its its really messy, i hate the UX so much. need improvement"
Fahmi Rezza,"I must admit, they did well to change something that bothered me, well not make ads disappear in wishlist (like i complained) but at least it looks different now so i can enjoy surfing my wishlist. Thanks tokopedia, you're really the best ecommerce in Indonesia."
Tania N,"I don't think this app is clear enough in terms of helping users to reach and converse with Tokopedia Care. I had to dive into thousands of categories to find the best category for my problem to fit in for minutes, only to find nothing. Then I had to look my problem up on search bar only to find nothing matched. I chose the best category to describe my problem so that I can have a human to help me solve my problem, only to find they only help users with transaction problems. Well played!"
Endah Yuliani,"The Tokopedia application is very helpful when this pandemic occurs, the completeness of the facilities is also good, but it would be nice if you can make payments using Tokopedia's balance. Through refunds and sales income, on Tokopedia, errors often occur when I track my shipments on the Tokopedia application, not yet. It hasn't been updated for 2 days, after I checked and checked it turned out that the results were different, please correct the error in the Tokopedia application"
boy william,"The New update is the worst ever. The interface is baffling. I have had no problem using Tokopedia app for a long time, it's been easy to use. However, the app is sluggish n error most of the time now. Please fix it."
BlueberryCupcake,"Why I give this app such a bad rating? Here's why: >The UX is a mess, especially the main menu tab, because it's literally got the same content w/ ""my account"" tab. UX gore right there. >Wishlist broke, resetting after going back to check the wishlisted product. >Still related with point one, the home screen feels too much to look at. 4-5 rows would be enough tho. How to fix? Go back into the past, when Tokped is such a compact yet clean app. Also please add dark mode opt, it's 2021 ffs."
Fadli Alim,"Everything is great with this app, from all of the stuff they sell, the safety of the delivery, to the transaction methods, but after the data leak I was a bit worried about buying and/or selling things on this app. But until this day, I haven't had any personal problems."
D P (DPA),"Good market online apps. Like to use it. User friendly. Need to get more items in this apps. Cannot give comments to unrecommended shop/seller before order made and if ordered cancelled by seller. Often asked, no answer at all or if answered, not professional responses. Interaction is one important judgement beside product quality, price and delivery. Many shops are still inactive. Those inactive shops/seller has to get judgment as well either from visitor after chatting or from provider/Toped"
A Google user,"I got problems using my vouchers since it's updated. I used my voucher but it didn't appear, so I didn't get the cashback, while it was stated already that I would receive 10% cashback. I've read it carefully before payment n I'M NOT BLIND! That statement would only appear if I use my voucher! So, OF COURSE I'VE USED THE VOUCHER I GOT !! Once I got a gift card but failed to redeem till almost expired. Then I got 2 gift cards again, but TOPED nvr sent me the code to redeem, lol funny ! UNINSTALLED"
Christopher Rio,"Lately the customer service experience, specially for Sellers, becoming worse and worse. There are instances of using AnterAja (Tokopedia's own courier subsidiary) making us Sellers to have to wait for weeks to get our payment due to AnterAja's incompetence in delivering people's order. Tokopedia: growing is one thing, but alienating tour loyal customer and seller base is another thing altogether!!"
Harist Dani Hisyam,"I'm extremely disappointed with Tokopedia's sudden 100% application charge increase and lack of communication. This drastic change has made me reconsider my options and search for a better platform. Sadly, only 1-star until they address this issue + move to other reasonable platform."
Sodiq Sulistiyanto,"Like.....like....like....but why when there is notification to update apps, I can't find update icon in play store, then I uninstall and re-install apps, i think this procedure is not good, after I reinstall apps and open apps, apps show notification ""ada gangguan di rumah Toped""... 16/12/2020....where is filter feature in category?"
A Google user,"Ordered 2 expensive speakers. The system didn't allow both to be delivered on the same day as the order, due to combined weight exceeding same day delivery limit. I had to order the two items seperately. Also applied cashback coupons. Now the Tokopedia is accusing me of trying to cheat and canceled the cashback. I bought Rp 3.7 million worth of speakers and they accuse me of cheating to get a measly Rp 100 thousand. Very insulting. Will try other online ahopping apps."
Nicolaus Euclides,"Mh experience using this e-commerce is great, but there are some few features that I check it doesn't in the place anymore. I'm looking for pay later feature from Kredivo, Home Credit, BRI Ceria, ect. They are not there. Is this a bug or a new policy that we didn't know? Please make an explanation for us."
Silvano Hajid,"This market place is not reliable to find solution for its customers. Corrupt system by seller and how they give extra time for seller to deliver the package through same day delivery service. They didn't listen how seller treat costumer in a lowest point, very late respond, item that I received on the next day is broken. So I uninstall this app, tried to find another healthy system marketplace. *Update* It's been a while and I see this app trying to find out what's the best for its customers."
A Google user,"The latest update ruins the app. I can't add items to my wishlist and my cart. Everytime I try to, it said there was an error and told me to try again but after trying for 15 minutes straight, it still doesn't work! Please fix this"
Noct Zero,"Having no problems with Tokopedia and likes it better than the other orange lag riddled digital shop competitor, until now. When opening other social media app it links itself to Tokopedia as Tokopedia forces itself open every time. Uninstalling Tokopedia is a temporary fix."
Mister Hans,As a Bule this app is frustrating. Some parts are translated in English but very little. Multiple packages I paid and don't arrive or are listed as arrived and arw not. So you have to go through a not so proactive xlcuatomer support. I would not recommend for a foreigner. Maybe shopee is better.
Risa Bluesaphier,"I'm a platinum member, was shopping a lot. But since some problem with seller take too long of solution. I'm stop shopping here. Still have this account just in case I can not shop at an other applications, so this is the last chance for me to shop by this application. I'm really disappointed with my case to seller on January 2020. And admin not really help me. And everytime I have to explain the case again and again to an other admin. Seems they are too lazy even to read. So stupid !"
Farras Farhan,"Tbh, it used to be the best ecommerce app I've been using. Today i tried to put stuff on my cart and this app keep crashing and stopping, So I uninstall then install it all over again, yet the problem still there, i couldnt get the stuff to my cart and the app keeps stopping. Please kindly address the problem. Thankyou"
Alvin Z,"Would you please let the users choose their default payment method or just let the fields empty, instead of automatically assigning the payment method? I have to cancel all my orders one by one just because I usually use Virtual Account as my payment method, but the system decided to use GoPayLater as my payment method automatically. I'll change my rating as soon as you guys fix that and that was not a great experience to say the least."
A Google user,"I had a great experience until today. I expected to receive an item via Go-Send and the driver on his own requested to cancel. ""but it's not tokopedia's fault"" you might think. Well... Tokopedia as a broker should take full responsibility for the reason I pay more to receive my items earlier. In their Help menu it's always about blaming the seller. I want to blame YOU Tokopedia. At least you should have a bit of control over your partner and tell them to compensate for your customers lost...!!!"
arizkun.,"I've used this app for more than 5 years, the recent update is upsetting me. You can't strictly search the item that you want, as there will be millions of items that ""you might like"" or closely named. I also noticed that they've removed the ""exclude words"" or whatever that is, resulting in longer searching time for the item. Please revert the update back, as this feature is what I (and perhaps others) was looking for when choosing a marketplace."
A Google user,"(1). It takes MUCH longer to load anything bc the app is cluttered with worthless ""deals"" and ""promotion coupons"". (2). Cust center is NO LONGER AVAILABLE. No option to actually talk to a capable Tokopedia CS officer (assuming there's any?). FAQs are unhelpful. (3). Flash sale is a joke. Sellers CANraise their price threefold before applying ""discounts"" so it'd look like they cut their item price by a lot. (4). Please get rid of the annoying egg thing. Nobody wants it, nobody cares about it."
Jasmine,"When I first got Tokopedia it was doing good, but after awhile I realized that their customer service isn't that good, they don't provide a phone number for one of tokopedia's agent and they don't return money to you if you do get scammed/fished. Overall I'd rate it a 3/5, I still use tokopedia but only for certain stuff."
Dandy Junaedi,"Tokopedia care takes a very long time to respond, it takes 10 minutes for one response even though it was answered before 30 seconds. The insurance policy is like a scam when there are already 10 policies that I have requested and not one has been received even though all the documentary evidence has been given and I am still being asked for it."
Hanzel Frederick,"Tokopedia should review their delivery partner capability. Shopee has better delivery partner than tokopedia. I will not use this apps again to buy expensive products. Use Shopee instead of Tokopedia. Shopee CS maybe unusefull, but the package come to the destination corectly so far. Don't tell me to 'hubungi kami', your CS told me that they can not do anything."
A Google user,"My transaction got cancelled by the merchant due to item out of stock. Merchant confirmed this cancellation directly to me via phone and the app even logs this event. Somehow I still get billed on my cc. Bank said they've never received any refund from Tokopedia (been 3 weeks since cancellation). Tokopedia CS can't resolve this issue promptly and refuse to investigate until I send her my billing (another 5 days wait), won't even bother tracing the status of my refund. Not shopping here again!"
Avrizal Alphard,"The app does not make improvements when in comes to loopholes where buyers are being cheated by dishonest sellers and are at loss. The machine handling customers' complaints has the worst algorithm and procedures among other similar platform. It is better to uninstall and move to other online shop app. To add to that, web/desktop version of this app is a mess."
A Google user,"The lastest update/change is disappointing. To force the consumers to use OVO is consumer's loss. Every Tokopedia cashback that we could use for transaction inside Tokopedia cannot be used anymore in Tokopedia. Instead, now, we only can use it inside OVO. OVO tenant where we can spend the points are limited. If we don't use it in OVO tenant, we have to use it for transaction of OVO's digital product, which is not as flexible and various as Tokopedia's digital product. I understand that with Google has a share in Tokopedia, it becomes more capitalist than it used to be. But this decision is a mere disappointment. Tokopedia, you have a position of bargain to push OVO to let OVO points be used inside Tokopedia, for every things Tokopedia sells, either for transaction of Tokopedia's digital product or in Tokopedia's tenant. I'm not the only one who disappoint on your decision. Review it and take a wise decision about it. Unless you want to lose us. It's better to kick OVO out of your system."
Posan Wongso,"I previously already installed ""Tokopedia"" app, then approx 3 months ago I installed ""Tokopedia seller"", since then caused I received double notification for every customer chat, discusdion and transaction, I felt annoyed by this double notification, so about 2 months ago I unistall ""Tokopedia seller"" with a hope that there would be no double notification anymore, but untill now I still receive double notification, can you tell me how to solve this problem ? tq"
A Google user,"Well, very very good app for selling and buying everything. This app is a package with complete features but looks simple. This app really helpful. With this app, become entrepreneurs isn't as hard as before. Only have one suggestion for development division of this company, me and people around me are agree that the recently update is confusing. The new updated makes us to get used again with the new display. Hope u can restore previous display. Because the new display makes us can't operate this app as capable as before. Many feature placed differently than before. That makes us likes being beginner user again. And for seller with massive orders, this is really seize more time and focus. So, with intention to build this app bigger time for time, please reconsider my suggestion. Tq u Tokopedia. :))"
